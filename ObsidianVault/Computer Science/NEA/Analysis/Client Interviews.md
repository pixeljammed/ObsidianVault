My main client is Lukas Hugman, one of my good friends. Lukas often has great trouble focusing with schoolwork and tends to get distracted very often. He'd like an app for his computer to help him focus as he often gets sidetracked playing video games or when his friends call him.
I asked him a few questions.

**What do you think would be an effective solution to your focus problem?**
In the past, I used a real life pomodoro timer for my GCSE studies, and this worked fairly well, but with my transitioning to sixth form most of my work is now digitized, so I've found the physical thing less than effective

I'd like an all-in-one pomodoro app which'll allow me to track how and when I am actually productive. Right now my study patterns are spotty and few and far in between and I think a schedule would be a perfect solution. Oftentimes I do my work digitally thanks to the nature of my work (sciences and programming) and I get distracted with other things on my computer, and get tunnel vision on unrelated topics. 
Maybe if there were features such as a heads-up display showing me the current task I'm dedicating a pomodoro block to, and the time remaining, I'd be reminded on what I'm currently supposed to be doing.
