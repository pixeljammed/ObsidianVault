**Alternative Project Proposal** (optional but recommended)
**Name:** Milo Tekchandani
**Class:** CO3
**Project title (Working title):** Online multiplayer boredom games

**Outline a description and the aims of your project:**
This would be a collection of small games that you could play with your friends, online, through a server and clients connection. These would vary in genre and difficulty and be free and easy to pick up and play.
I would like to implement a saving system where your scores and wins are saved, and perhaps I could implement some sort of long term progression or cosmetics to encourage people to come back or play consistently.
I think this would be good as current services like www.jkml.fun, and www.gartic.phone and scribble.io are good and popular. However none of them seem to take themselves too seriously or have long term rewards or progression, etc, and I think people would find this fun and rewarding, and make them come back.

**Potential client/ third party/ end-user(s) and who they are e.g. a local business owner, a person interested in board games:**	
- People my age
- People who might be bored
- Long-distance relationships/friendships (for instance people who might have friends who have moved or are in a different country)

**What kind of access do you have to your potential end-user?**	
I have my own friend groups, both online and in person who will no doubt be interested in this!

**What potential programming skills (from Table 1 or skills that are not listed) will it enable you to demonstrate?**	
- WPF + XAML
- C# and .NET
- Object Oriented Programming
- API / library usage (ex: RawInput)

**What data will your system potentially store and access?**
- A database to store the English words, and user scores and names.
- Could feature saving and cloud storage.

**Have you prototyped part of the project? If so, describe it and the next steps:**
I have prototyped a small part – using window’s low level raw input API.
It currently has a nice gradient background, and just displays text showing the last key pressed along with the device ID.
I have written more about this in the Week 1 of reflections.
