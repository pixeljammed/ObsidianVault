The **Non-Examined Assessment** is a programming project worth 20% of the AQA Computer Science A Level. It is designed to reflect the whole lifecycle of a typical project: analysis, design, solution, testing, and evaluation.

- The project is carried out over an extended period - the timescales are shown in the "Key Dates" table on this page. 
- It is important that these deadlines are met, and they have been selected so that you can maintain a sensible/manageable rate of progress on your project.
- *It is not easy to get a high grade, and good time management is key to success*.
- You will need to choose your project carefully, organise your time efficiently, and work hard. You will need to learn some new skills and techniques in order to analyse, design, and document your solution.
