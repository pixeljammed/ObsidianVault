I did an interview with my client, Lukas, in regards to his studying habits. I asked him 12 questions in relation to what he would want for his general purpose study / productivity app to help him focus on schoolwork.

**1. How do you usually organise your study sessions or schoolwork?**
- _Lukas:_ I usually just jot down tasks in my notebook, but it’s not very structured. Sometimes I’ll use my phone's reminders, but I forget about them after a while.

**2. How often do you use productivity apps or tools while studying?**

- _Lukas:_ I’ve tried a few, like **Forest** and the default timer on my phone. But I don’t use them consistently—I tend to lose focus or get distracted by notifications.

**3. What are your biggest distractions when you’re trying to study or focus?**

- _Lukas:_ Definitely my phone—social media, texts, random apps. I also find myself getting distracted by emails or browsing the internet.

**4. How do you track your progress during study sessions?**

- _Lukas:_ Honestly, I don’t track it very well. I might mentally check off what I’ve finished, but I don’t have a system. It would be nice to see some kind of progress visually.

**5. What would motivate you to stay focused longer during a study session?**

- _Lukas:_ Maybe having some kind of reward system or a way to break tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. I like the idea of small goals, and seeing immediate progress.

**6. Have you ever used a Pomodoro timer or any other time-management method? If so, how did it work for you?**

- _Lukas:_ Yeah, I’ve used the Pomodoro method before. It works well at first, but I tend to forget to restart the timer after breaks. I wish the apps I used had more reminders or something to keep me going.

**7. What would be the most important feature for you in a study app?**

- _Lukas:_ A distraction-blocker would be huge, like something that stops me from accessing social media or certain apps. And maybe a timer that’s flexible with breaks and lets me see my time spent studying.

**8. Do you prefer a structured study schedule, or do you like to have more flexibility?**

- _Lukas:_ I prefer flexibility. I’m not great with rigid schedules, so an app that can adjust to how I’m feeling would be better. Like, if I’m in the zone, I don’t want a forced break.

**9. Would you find it helpful if an app could integrate with your calendar or to-do list?**

- _Lukas:_ Yeah, definitely. I already use Google Calendar, so syncing it with the app would be helpful. It could remind me of upcoming tasks or let me schedule study blocks easily.

**10. What kind of analytics or feedback would you like to see after a study session?**

- _Lukas:_ I’d like to know how long I studied, which subjects or tasks took the most time, and maybe how consistent I’ve been over the week. Also, something that tells me if I’m improving or getting distracted more would be useful.

**11. If an app could guide you through a study session, how much control would you want over its settings?**

- _Lukas:_ I’d want a good amount of control. I’d like to adjust the timer lengths, choose different modes for focus, and set my own breaks. At the same time, it should be simple and not overwhelming to use.

**12. What would make you want to continue using this app long-term?**

- _Lukas:_ The app would need to be reliable and flexible, but not too complicated. If it could also give me personalised suggestions, like “you’ve been distracted a lot today, maybe try a different approach,” I’d definitely keep using it. Also, having real rewards or progress tracking over time would be a big incentive to stay consistent.
