This section is divided into 2 different sections:
1) Commercial
2) Open Source

-----
## Commercial Software
The first section is proprietary, commercially sold studying programs. These cost money or have a freemium model, and are sold on app stores / as a paid product.

#### [Session](https://stayinsession.com/)
![[Pasted image 20241017100001.png]]

**Session** is an "absolutely ridiculous" app (as quoted from [zapier.com](https://zapier.com/blog/best-pomodoro-apps/#session)), but is very good in what it does. The app's creator, Phillip Young, says on a blog that he made it because he simply could not find a pomodoro app that fit his specification. He wanted an app with:
1. Looked aesthetically pleasing.
2. Had analytics.
3. Less restrictions (no *timer rule*, for instance).

He set off to create the best possible pomodoro app for Apple devices, and I would say he did that very well. **Session** contains features you would expect from a pomodoro app such as a customisable timer, changeable lengths, keyboard shortcuts and a nice menu bar integration for macOS. However where the app stands out from more simpler alternatives is with its extras, such as syncing between the macOS and iOS app, detailed analytics, integration with both calendar and reminder apps, and website/distraction blocking. 
In addition it also supports the latest apple features, such as live activity in the dynamic island on the latest iPhone models, and integration with Apple Shortcuts and Automations.

Finally, it also has user-care features, such as beginning each "session" as it is called with mindful breathing exercises, and you are prompted to take notes in order to reflect on your productivity. It is a very feature-complete app and is a great choice for mac users.

It is monetized using a freemium system - where an annual subscription for "pro" features costs around £39.99 a year, or £4.99 for a month. However, the developers sees a great deal of revenue coming from this, as evidenced in a blog post he made.

His greatest regret, according to himself, is not making it cross platform, as windows dominates the personal computer market while mac only takes up around 14.6%. He claims he could have potentially doubled his revenue if he made it for both windows and mac. In order for me to have the biggest target audience / greatest number of clients I should aim to create the software for both major OS's.

**Pros**
- A very extensive pomodoro timer and has the most fleshed out and expanded features.
- Syncs between mac, iPad, iPhone and Apple Watch.
- Great looking design.
- Has proven profitable for the developer.

**Cons**
- Very expensive (£40 for a year).
- Only for apple devices.

#### [Forest](https://forestapp.cc/)
![[CleanShot 2024-10-17 at 20.06.28@2x.png]]

**Forest** aims to be a solution to smartphones being a distraction while you work. If you still need your phone around you while working for calls or important messages, **Forest** aims to eliminate the distraction.

The basic idea of the app, available for both Apple and Android devices is to provide an interface to your studying, in the form of a tree that grows as you focus. The longer you focus for the more the tree grows, and when you are finished studying, the tree is planted in a personal garden.

The tree and garden aspect aim to "**gamify**" the act of studying and act as a fun, and cute way for users to track their progress and visualise it in an appealing way, potentially encouraging the user to study more. This is a method used by apps like Duolingo, for instance, in the form of their streaks being a proven, effective way to keep users both using the app and creating a healthy habit. You also unlock coins, so you can get new trees or even plant a real one.

There's also a social aspect to Forest, where if you have classmates, colleges, peers or alike using the app as well, you can compare to see who can focus for longer or have a bigger garden. 

Forest is not strictly a pomodoro timer, by that nature, you can focus for as long as you want. However, it is ranked very highly on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the their respective productivity categories. In fact, it's the #1 productivity app in over 136 countries!

My favourite feature of the app, as I've used it personally, is the *Deep Focus Mode* which effectively forces you to keep your phone only on that app, ending your timer if you switch apps. This is how it removes the distraction of your phone, if you are very dedicated to your garden!

The only real problem I see with the app is that you actually have to remember to use it in order for it to be effective. The app does have the ability to set a reminder to use it, but I found this hard as I was undiagnosed with my ADHD at the time. But this is more down to user error than anything.

**Pros**
- Very good app.
- Costs much less compared to [[1 - Existing Solutions#[Session](https //stayinsession.com/)|Session]].
- One-time purchase, which customers usually favour.

**Cons**
- Infrequent updates.
- Charges for "premium" features, even after the initial purchase of the app.
- Completely dominates mobile device market for productivity.


#### [Toggl](https://toggl.com/)
![[CleanShot 2024-10-17 at 20.54.14@2x.png]]

**Toggl** is primarily a time tracking software, more than anything, meant for people who are being paid by the hour in an organization, for instance. This way they can track how long they have worked for, what work they've done, and thereby invoice for the correct amount. My father, for instance, uses this particular product as he finds it invaluable for the things mentioned above.

**Toggl** is very easy to use. If you want to track what you're doing, you can start a timer. You don't need to specify what project you're working on or who the client is: you can do that after. For instance you can set the timer to count down in your chosen Pomodoro length (25 minutes by default), then take a five-minute break.

However Toggl is more marketed towards teams and corporations, and less of an individual. For most people its features might be a bit too much overkill, unless you are something like a contractor, for instance.

**Pros**
- Integrates with Toggl's other time-tracking and invoicing tools well.
- Pomodoro timer doesn't feel like an afterthought, despite not being a major feature.

**Cons**
- Overkill for the average user.
- Meant for organisations and not solo users.

## Open Source Software
This section details open-source solutions for study and productivity, which are freely available for anyone to use and modify. Unlike commercial products, these apps are typically maintained by community contributions and are often highly customisable.

#### [Pomotroid](https://splode.github.io/pomotroid/)

![[CleanShot 2024-10-17 at 21.44.47@2x.png]]

**Pomotroid** is a free and open-source Pomodoro timer app that boasts a clean, simple, and user-friendly interface. It’s an excellent option for users who want an easy-to-use timer without the additional complexity that comes with other, more feature-packed software.

The app provides basic Pomodoro functionality, allowing users to set work and break intervals and track their time. It also supports customisable settings, including work/break durations and session limits. Since it's open-source, those with programming skills can modify the app’s code to better fit their needs.

Although **Pomotroid** is a minimalist solution, it lacks some of the features power users would expect from commercial software like **Session** or **Forest**, such as deep analytics, distraction blocking, or syncing between devices.

**Pros**
- Completely free and open-source.
- Simple and clean interface.
- Customisable timer settings.
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

**Cons**
- Lacks advanced features like analytics and syncing.
- No mobile app or cloud support for syncing across devices.
- Has not been updated in 5 years.

#### [Pomatez](https://zidoro.github.io/pomatez/)

![[CleanShot 2024-10-17 at 22.33.29@2x.png]]

**Pomatez** is another open-source Pomodoro timer that aims to balance simplicity with some useful features, making it a step up from **Pomotroid** in terms of functionality. It includes all the essential features you'd expect, such as adjustable work/break intervals, a to-do list for tasks, and sound notifications when sessions end.

One standout feature of **Pomatez** is its focus mode, which minimizes distractions by hiding the interface while the timer is running. It also offers more control over settings than simpler alternatives, with options for customizing sounds, themes, and even shortcuts for quick access. The app works across multiple platforms and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

As an open-source project, **Pomatez** benefits from community contributions, though like many open-source projects, it doesn't have consistent updates and lacks depth.

**Pros**
- Free and open-source.
- Includes task management tools and focus mode.
- Customisable themes and sound settings.
- Cross-platform compatibility.

**Cons**
- Limited features compared to paid apps.
- Lacks distraction-blocking features.

#### [Weektodo](https://weektodo.me/)

![[CleanShot 2024-10-17 at 22.32.39@2x.png]]

**Weektodo** is an open-source task management tool. It is a to-do list app and **Weektodo** integrates time management features that can be useful for students or professionals looking to organise their weekly tasks with timed study sessions.

Its strength lies in its simplicity and focus on helping users organise tasks by week, which can be great for short-term planning. **Weektodo** is simply a to do task that lets you seperate tasks by day or week and classify them - which could be useful for students who want to schedule when to do assignments for instance, or seperate them by subject.

**Weektodo** also has very good integration with other apps like Apple Reminders and

**Pros**
- Free and open-source.
- Good integration with other apps.
- Available on multiple platforms.

**Cons**
- Lacks more advanced features such as analytics or device syncing.
