Real world problems use collections of data.

This might be:
- A **sequence / list** - a collection of data which is ordered. E.g: List, Stack, Queue
- **Set** - A collection of data with no order, in which no duplication is allowed.
- **Graph** - a collection of data where some pairs of items are connected by links. E.g: trees, networks.

How can we model these in programming?
