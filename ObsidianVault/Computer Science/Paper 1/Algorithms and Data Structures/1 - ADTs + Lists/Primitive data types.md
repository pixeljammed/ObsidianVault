Primitive data types are data types which only have one value (scalar).

For instance:
- Integer
- Float / double
- Boolean

Here is how they are used in programming languages

```c#
// Primitive types in C#
string myName = "Milo"
int myAge = 17;
float willyLength = 10.4;
char initial = myName[0];

bool virgin = true;
```

```python
# Primitive types in Python
last_name = "Tekchandani"
shoe_size = 53
reaction_time = 0.00001
favourite_letter = "P"
# Python does not have 

virgin = True
```

Python is not a strictly-typed language unlike C#, and handles variable types for you. You don't need to explicitly declare the type.

```c#
// C# specific ones
byte myByte = 255; // 0 to +255  
sbyte mySByte = -128; // -128 to +127  
int myInt = -2147483648; // -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647  
uint myUInt = 4294967295; // 0 to +4,294,967,295  
long myLong = -9223372036854775808; // Â±9,223,372,036,854,775,808
ulong myULong = 18446744073709551615; // 0 to +18,446,744,073,709,551,615 
short myShort = -32768; // -32,768 to +32,767  
ushort myUShort = 65535; // 0 to +65,535
```
