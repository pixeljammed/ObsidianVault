A static data structure is a data structure with a fixed size, meaning the amount of memory allocated is determined at the time of its creation and cannot change during runtime.

**Characteristics**:
- The size is predefined and cannot grow or shrink dynamically.
- Memory allocation is contiguous and fixed.
- Efficient in terms of memory access due to fixed size and layout.
