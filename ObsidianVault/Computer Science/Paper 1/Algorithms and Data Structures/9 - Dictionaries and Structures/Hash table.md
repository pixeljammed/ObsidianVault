## Questions
**State two advantages of using hashing and the hash table approach over the alternative approach which just stores records in an ordinary table starting from the first row**
1. Faster search time (typically O(1) time instead of linear search's O(n) time).
2. Quicker to retrieve or delete records.


**It is noticed that after inserting many records into a hash table that uses closed hashing, searches are taking much longer than they used to.**
1. **Explain why this is the case**
	   A large number of collusions have occurred which means that a significant number of records are not actually generated by applying the hash function to the key value.
	   If the record is not in the location generated by the hash function, then the following memory locations have to be checked instead. Too many of these will caused search time to rise.
	   
1. **Suggest a solution that could potentially restore searching times how they were.**
	   Rehash the table using a different hash function that will generate fewer collisions.
	   

**Explain why it is necessary to store the hash key in a hash table**
- More than one hash key may hash to the same address. The hash key must be stored in order to check for a possible clash.
