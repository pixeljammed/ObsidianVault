## Definition
A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Stacks are often implemented using arrays or linked lists in high level languages like C#.

### Use Cases:
- **Function Call Stack**: Manages function calls in most programming languages.
- **Undo Mechanism**: In applications (text editors, etc.), the undo feature can be implemented using stacks.
- **Parenthesis Matching**: Used in compilers or text editors to validate balanced parentheses.
