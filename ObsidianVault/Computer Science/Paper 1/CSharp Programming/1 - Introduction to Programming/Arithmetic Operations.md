Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

|  Operator | Symbol | Description                                  |    Example   |
|:---------:|:------:|----------------------------------------------|:------------:|
|  Addition |    +   | Adds two values                              |   2 + 2 = 4  |
|  Subtract |    -   | Takes one value away from the other          | 60 - 20 = 40 |
|  Multiply |    *   | Times two values together                    |  7 * 8 = 56  |
|   Divide  |    /   | Divides one value by another                 | 6 / 3 = 2    |
|   Modulo  |    %   | Same as above but returns the remainder      | 25 % 2 = 1   |
| Floor Div |   //   | Divides one value by another but rounds down | 19 // 3 = 6  |

They can be used and stacked with one ano ther in accordance to BIDMAS order and brackets can be utilised. In addition you can write indicies by using ^ to indicate an power.

For example...

```
Console.Log(4 + 6);
```

...would output 10!


And for a more advanced example

```
int answer = (10 * 6) + 700
Console.Log(answer)
```

...would output 760.
