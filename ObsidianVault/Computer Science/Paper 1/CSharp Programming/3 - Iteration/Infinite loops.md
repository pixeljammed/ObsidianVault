By make use of a [[While loops]] in which the condition is simply "true", you will have an infinitely repeating loop. By putting a "true" as the condition you're basically telling the code "repeat this until 2+2 =/= 4".

To break out of this loop you must have a **break**, or as it's written in C#, "break;".
