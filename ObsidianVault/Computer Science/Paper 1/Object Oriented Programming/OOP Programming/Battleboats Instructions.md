1. **Plot your ships:** Drop your ships on the grid strategically. Don't be too random; it's not a lottery.

2. **Call the shots:** Type in your coordinates like a pro. In the format of A4, B7, B4 for example.

3. **Game:** If you end up hitting one of your opponents ships, well done! If you don't, wait for your turn and try again.

4. **Hit:** It's then your opponents turn. Be patient and pray they don't hit you

Whoever sinks all their opponent's ships first wins. Good luck and have fun.
