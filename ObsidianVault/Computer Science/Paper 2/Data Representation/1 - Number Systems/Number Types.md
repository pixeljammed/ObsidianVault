Numbers, in both math and programming, can have a variety of attributes, which must be taken into account if you are to use them in your code (for example, using [[Arithmetic Operations]] on them).

Every number ever fits into one of these categories.
They **don't** have to fit into only just **one** of these categories though.

> [!TLDR] TL:DR
> - **Integer** - any whole number // ex: -8
> - **Natural** - any positive whole number // ex: 5
> - **Rational** - a number with an exact value (reocurring included) // ex: 2.5
> - **Irrational** - a number without an exact value // ex: π
> - **Real** - any positive number with

## Types
- **Natural**
	- Any positive whole/integer with the exception of 0 all the way to infinite; but not including.
	- Some example of one would be:
		- 28 
		- 621
		- 9001
	
- **Integer**
	- Any whole number - including negatives this time, but not infinity or anything alike.
	- Some examples:
		- -8
		- 69
		- 1337
	
- **Rational**
	- A rational number is pretty much any number, so this time it includes non integers and stuff with decimal points. If it has an exact value (including reoccurings) then it is a rational number.
	- Some examples:
		- 69.420
		x- √16
	
- **Irrational**
	- An irrational number is any real number that can't be expressed as a fraction, basically means it has no exact value
	- Some examples:
		- √2
		- √7 
		- [[100,000 DIGITS OF PI|pi]]
		- Euler's Constant 
	
- **Real**
	- A real number, is effectively any number that can be written or **plotted on a number line.**
	- It is a DEFINITE number, one that is **REAL** and not an effective concept like infinity
	- Some examples would include:
		- 4.432
		- 8398
		- 36828
	
- Ordinal
	- An ordinal number refers to numbers indicating of something's position
	- Some examples could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 1738th...
