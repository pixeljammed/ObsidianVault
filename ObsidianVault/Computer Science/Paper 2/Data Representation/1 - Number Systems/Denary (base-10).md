Us humans count in BASE-10, or Denary as it's better said. This is because we have 10 fingers and as so little kids in preschool will find it easier to count because they can count on their hands!

However there are other ways, where it doesn't just go up to 9 per digit. Denary has 10 possible symbols/numbers per digit:

	0
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
	6
	7
	8
	9

But there are other number systems such as the ones below that can go up to 16 [[hexadecimal]], or even less like only having 2 possible values per digit. You might wonder why we need to use these - the answer is because of limitations in computers and how electrical circuits work for binary, and hexadecimal because it can show binary in a shorter way (for us humans to read), and it's very easy to convert between the two (16 is a multiple of 2).
