>Two's compliment, not to be confused with [[Parity bit]]s is a concept sometimes used within binary representation of negative/positive numbers. 


When representing **real** numbers in binary (see [[Number Types]]) you have to have some sort of way to indicate if a number is negative or not - and as a result this is where two's compliment comes in!

The first bit in the number, known as the sign, is either a one or zero, which tells 

>First bit = 0 = positive number
>First bit = 1 = negative number
