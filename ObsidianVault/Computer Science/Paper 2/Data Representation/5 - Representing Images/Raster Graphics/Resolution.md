>Resolution is a the number of pixels used within a [[Bitmap Graphics]] file.

It is the width and height of pixels used to make up a bitmap image, which give you the number of pixels used to make the image.

Resolution does not define the actual physical size of the image - you can scale an image as you want but the actual resolution won't change - hence the reason the for the pixelation when you scale a bitmap image up.
