Vector graphics are a type of graphics which are *technically speaking* effectively lossless in terms of quality. For instance if you zoom in on a .png or raster graphic/bitmap file, you will see a noticeable drop in quality - the pixels will become apparent and you can see the rough edges, whilst in a vector image zooming in on it, it will still be smooth all the while.

Why, you might ask? This is because of the fact that vectors are not made up of pixels - instead the file format consists of coordinates and data that the image was made from.

To quote Adobe, the creator of the widely popular **.SVG** vector file format:

```
"As opposed to pixel-based raster files like JPEGs, vector filesÂ store images via mathematical formulas based on points and lines on a grid."

A popular example of a vector image would be **fonts**! Although fonts are typically **.TTF's** (which are pretty much just .zips with data and the .svgs in them) they do not lose their quality when you zoom into them! If you don't believe me go into word and put the font size to something stupid like 250 lol.

**SVGs and vector graphics are instead made of 2d scalable objects which are coded and are lossless when zooming in.**

*An example of an .SVG - it's actually a jpeg for display purposes but it really is an SVG I promise.*
