## Bits
A **bit** is the smallest possible unit of measurement for data in computer science.  It is essentially a switch which can be either in the state of off (0) or on (1). It is the most basic and primitive thing of everything we know to do with technology. They are typically found in clusters called bytes - which is a group of 8 bits together

## Bytes
Bytes are a group of 8 bits can be used for many things. They can be used to represent a number up to 255 (8-bit number) or an ASCII character for example

| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

#### Together bits and bytes make up every piece of data stored on a computer.
This is why computer files are stored with the size in "bytes" or "kilobytes", "megabytes", etc.
So if a game *.exe* file says it is 250mb then it is actually 250,000,000 bytes - or 8x250,000,00=2,000,000,000 (2 BILLION) bytes big (isn't it crazy files this big are made up of ones and zeros?)

For a real example, this MP3 file I had on my iPod in 2016 took up 4MB of space - or 4 million bytes approx. That's a lot of 1's and 0's.
