When data is transmitted, either via cable or wirelessly or over the internet etc... it doesn't always arrive in the same format that it was sent.
- Electrical interference
- Power surges
- Synchronisation issues (hey - like obsidian!)
- Wear and tear on the cable or connectors.
These errors can cause bits to flip from 1s and 0s to 0s and 1s

How do we correct this?
Well, for one you could use a [[]] for verification.
