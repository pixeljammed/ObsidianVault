## Sound (microphones)

>A sound physically in the real world is literally composed of air particles vibrating in such a specific way that our eardrums perceive it as audible noise (this is why shockwaves can damage your hearing and are audible because they shock/vibrate the air). 

Sound waves travel through the air, and as they reach your ear (the speed of sound) your eardrums vibrate and convert that sound into something your brain can **percieve**. This is kind of how microphones convert soundwaves into digital data. See soundwaves in the real world are classified as analogue data as they vary continuously in shape and size - see [[Analogue VS Digital data]] for more info.

These sound waves can be converted by microphone as the diaphragm (coil below) is sensitive to the vibrations and can measure the distance the coil moves.

From the rate of vibration from the sound wave, we can get the frequency of a sound
From the distanced moved by the coil, we can get the amplitude (louder = bigger distance)

However it can only measure this distance every so often - which is the called the *sample rate*.
A sample means the frequency and amplitude of the sound wave is recorded for a split second.

## Wave properties

- Amplitude - how much the wave height varies, how high the peaks go - which is like the loudness of a sound kinda

- Frequency - the number of "waves" per second measured in Hz - which the variation in which makes sounds sound different
	- FOR INSTANCE - if I were to play a soundwave with a frequency of 10000 for 5 seconds it would sound like a continuous low beep (depending on the waveform - square wave = beep) for 5 seconds.

>Most sound files have a sample rate of 44100hz - which means  44100 samples are taken per second

The samples are then played back to back directly after each other so fast it sounds continuous, and these are stored as a file like MP3, WAV, OGG etc. so the data can be played back later + kept forever.

## Sample ~~rate~~

**Sample rate**, or sampling frequency, is shown below.
