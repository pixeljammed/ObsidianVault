The MIDI standard (**M**usical **I**nstrument **D**igitial **I**nterface) makes sound by playing pre-made sounds (like a drum kick or piano key) as determined from a:

- MIDI (Digital) instrument
- From a **piece of software** (i.e: Ableton Live, FL Studio)
- Or played back straight from a **.midi file**

In easier terms, it is not a live recording, but a digitally created sound.

## What's the benefit?
The benefit is that .midi files will be much smaller in size than a live recording *(think .mp3 and .wavs)* because mp3s have constantly do [[Sampling|sampling]] 44100x a second - whereas in a MIDI sounds are simply queued to play at a certain time in the song.

The signals to play said sounds are very small, about 2 or 3 bytes long - significantly reducing the data transferred

Another one is MIDI is a very universally accepted format by many DAWs (Digital Audio Editors)

## Downsides
In 2023, MIDI is pretty limited in comparison to modern standards. A lot of DAWs use their own custom formats as a result.
