File compression in computer science is a technique used to reduce the size of files, making them easier to store and faster to transfer. This is a fundamental concept at various educational levels, including A-Level.

There are two main types of file compression:

1. [[Lossless Compression]]:
    
    - Lossless compression algorithms reduce file size without losing any information.
    
    - This means the original file can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed file. This type of compression is essential for text documents, source code, and certain image formats (like PNG) where loss of data would be unacceptable.
    
    - Common lossless compression algorithms include:
	    - [[Huffman Encoding]]
	    - [[Run-Length encoding]]
	    - [[ZIP compression]]
	
    - Lossless compression is generally preferred for archival purposes and for applications where data integrity is crucial.
    
2. [[Lossy Compression]]:
    
    - Lossy compression techniques reduce file size by eliminating redundant or less important information, making it impossible to recover the original file exactly. This type of compression is typically used for audio, video, and images, where a perfect reproduction of the original is not necessary for the file to still be useful or enjoyable.
    
    - Common lossy compression algorithms include JPEG for images, MP3 for audio, and MPEG for video files.
    
    - The advantage of lossy compression is that it can achieve much higher compression ratios than lossless compression.

When studying file compression at an A-Level, you might encounter key concepts such as:

- Encoding and Decoding: The processes of converting data into a compressed format and reverting it back to the original or a close approximation of the original, respectively.
- Compression Ratio: The ratio of the compressed file size to the original file size.
- Redundancy: The repetition of information in a file that can be exploited to compress the file size.
- Entropy: A measure of the randomness or disorder in a file, which can affect how well it can be compressed.
- Algorithms: Specific methods used to perform compression and decompression.
- Data Transmission: The benefits of compression in reducing the time and bandwidth required to transmit files over networks.

Understanding file compression involves both theoretical knowledge of the algorithms used and practical skills in applying these algorithms to actual data. It can also include writing code to implement compression algorithms, analysing the trade-offs between different compression methods, and considering the impact of compression on file quality and system performance.
