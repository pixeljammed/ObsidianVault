- An input device is one which can be used to **put** **data and information** **into** a computer. 
- Conversely, an [[Output Device]] is one which can be used to send/display information from the computer.

## Examples
- **Keyboard** - Used to enter text into a computer 
- **Webcam** - A camera used by a computer to take photos and record videos
- **Magnetic stripe reader** - Used to read data from magnetic stripes on cards like credit and debit cards
- **Barcode reader** - Used in supermarket checkouts and access control systems to read information from printed labels and cards

-----
## Extra
Important things to consider when purchasing an input device could be **speed** and **accuracy of input**. Different devices will be able to transfer data at faster rates or to record information in greater detail - for example a **higher quality webcam** (which would be more expensive). 

In addition, cost and relevance must be considered. Is this device the right one for the task?


> [!NOTE] Input *AND* Output devices
> A small number of devices can be categorised as both input and output devices. For example, a touch screen outputs information in a visual way like a monitor, while acting as a device for touch input
