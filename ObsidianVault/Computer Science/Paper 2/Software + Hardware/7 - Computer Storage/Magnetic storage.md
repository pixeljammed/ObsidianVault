- Devices which store information magnetically represent binary information using two magnetic states: **polarised** and **unpolarised**.
	- If a portion of magnetic material is polarised, all magnetic poles align and can be read by a read/write head passing over the region. 
	- If an area is not polarised, magnetic poles are randomly scattered and produce a different reading on a read/write head. 
	
	- These two states can represent `1` and `0`, allowing any information to be represented in binary form.

- The most common type of magnetic storage is **hard disk drives**. However, magnetic tape can also store information magnetically (ex: **Cassettes**)
