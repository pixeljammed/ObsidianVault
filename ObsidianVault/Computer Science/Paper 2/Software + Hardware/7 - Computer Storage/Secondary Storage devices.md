Secondary storages refers to components which unlike [[primary storage]], does not lose its data after power is lost.

The reason why this is useful is because programs and applications and documents can be kept **permanently** instead of in memory, which will be lost after shut-down.

## Primary vs Secondary storage
- Primary storage is volatile, typically means RAM or ROM.
- Secondary storage refers to non-volatile storage
	- [[Magnetic storage]] such as the **hard disk**.
	- [[Optical storage]] that uses laser light such as **CDs**.
	- [[Solid-State disks]] using **Flash memory**.

| **Type** | **Durability** | **Speed** | **Capacity** | **Portability** | **Cost** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Hard disk - magnetic | Reasonable, but prone to damage if dropped or knocked | Slow | 500 GB-12 TB | Internal devices are fixed. External hard disks are portable | Cheap |
| CD-RW - optical | Easily scratched, damaged or broken | Very slow | 640 MB | Very portable | Very cheap |
| Solid-state drive - solid state | Robust and resilient | Very fast | 256 GB-4 TB | Internal devices are fixed. External hard disks are portable | Very expensive |
