Optical storage devices are written and read to by **Lasers**.

[[Boolean Logic|Binary information]] is read from spinning discs - which have a long sequence of microscopic portions which are either **flats** or **pits**.
- **Flats** - which are flat areas which reflect the laser.
- **Pits** - Hollow pits which scatter the laser.


The laser will bounce off the geometry accordingly and into a reader, which if reflected into by a land will output a 1.

## Variations
As technology developed we made better and better iterations/versions of optical storage, starting with **CD**'s and going up to the latest **Blu-Ray** tech.


- ### CDs
	- CD stands for **compact disc**. 
	- They use optical technology to store small quantities of information.
	- Most commonly used for audio files, CDs can also be used to store text and digital images.
	- CDs are small, thin and light which makes them very portable. Their disadvantages include being easily damaged by scratches, their limited storage capacity and relatively slow transfer speeds.
	- Varieties of CD include: 
		- CD-R which can only be written to once.
		- CD-RW which can be written to more than once.
		- CD-ROM which is written to during production and can then only be read from.

- ## DVDs 
	- DVD stands for **digital versatile disc** / **digital video disc**.
	- Similar to CDs, DVDs are also optical devices which have a **higher** storage capacity than CDs, making them suited to storing digital videos which require more storage space than audio files or photos.

- ## Blu-Ray
	- An advancement over DVDs, blu-ray discs have more than five times as much storage than traditional DVDs, making them useful for storing high-resolution films.
