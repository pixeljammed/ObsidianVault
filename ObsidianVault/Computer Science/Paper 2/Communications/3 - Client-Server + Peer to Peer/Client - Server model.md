## Real - world example
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive works on a client-server basis, meaningÂ you have a **game client installed on your computer** and there's a PC with the server configuration elsewhere. To play the game, you have to **connect the client to the server**.

Counter Strike uses a [[Computer Science/Paper 2/Communications/3 - Client-Server + Peer to Peer/Client - Server model]] because the game is competitive - and not like a simple coop game which would use a [[Peer to Peer model]] instead.
A centralised server means that there's control over quality of connection, and the input/output is fairly received
for all.
