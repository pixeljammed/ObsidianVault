Data is transmitted between digital devices using one of the two methods âˆ’ serial transmission or parallel transmission.
- **Serial Transmission** - bits of data are sent one after the other along the same data line.
- **Parralel Transmission** - several bits of data are sent at the same time along multiple seperate data lines.

## A short history of communications in computers
>Back when computers were first around, computers could only communicate through serial connections
>- Using serial connection, bits were sent one after the other
>- This only worked one way - for the computer to talk back another line would be needed

## Serial vs Parallel
- Serial data transmission is frequently used for transmitting data over medium to long distances, such as from wired peripherals like mice and keyboards to your computer.
- Parallel data transmission is used for more short distance things, like on the inside of your computer (ex: the bus between your CPU and RAM)
	- The reason why is because of [[skew]]
	- Over long distances, pa
