## Question #1
**There have been some cases where law enforcement officers have requested a phone manufacturer to bypass access restrictions on a phone that they believe contains evidence of criminal activity.**
**The manufacturers frequently refuse to do so.**

**Discuss a range of ethical and legal issues raised by the manufacturer agreeing or refusing to bypass access restrictions to the contents of the phone.**

**In your answer you will be assessed on your ability to follow a line of reasoning to produce a coherent, relevant and structured response.**

Answer:
- The phone manufactures have a certain level of integrity and privacy for their users, and to break or bypass their phone securities like this would also be to compromise their "private" reputation, and cause clients to distrust manufacturers.
- This can lead to a slippery slope - what makes this one case so special? Where do you draw the line? This can lead to many future occurrences of this happening, as a "one-off" turns into many such cases.
- However, the device might be the *only* thing standing between justice, and can quite literally be the key part of evidence. For instance in 2022, a [Nintendo Switch was used by the FBI to find an abducted girl](https://eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-used-by-fbi-to-find-abducted-girl#:~:text=she%20then%20used%20the%20console). 
- Therefore you could argue the manufacturers refusing to let them access the encrypted data is a breach of human rights, and the law, for example breaking the The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) in the UK.

## Question #2
**A company employs a team of programmers to develop software to control a fleet of driverless cars, providing a taxi service for clients in a large city.**

**Discuss a range of moral, ethical, legal and cultural issues that the programmers may need to consider whilst developing the service and that may arise during the use of the service by the public.**

**In your answer you will be assessed on your ability to follow a line of reasoning to produce a coherent, relevant and structured response.**

Answer:
- Driverless technology is inhereitly dangerous, being undeveloped in most areas and as such might not be ready for commercialized use as of present
- The programmers need to fully realize that their simple programming mistakes may lead to the loss of lives for either the passengers or pedestrians, and they need to have absolute certainty in their algorithm.
- This technology may enable human taxi drivers to lose out on customers and therefore their living wage, and could also lead to the loss of jobs as humans are replaced by AI.
- The technology is prone to being much more erroneous unlike a typical human cab driver.
- They will have to develop a defence against hackers if they want it to be all connected to a system like it says in the question - or else risk the hackers potentially endangering the lives of passengers.

## Question #3
**Google have a service called Street View which allows a user to view surroundings from street-level.**

**Google have extended their Street View service to cover the inside of buildings such as museums and sports stadiums.**

**Discuss a range of ethical, legal and cultural issues that Google may have needed to deal with when extending the service.**

Answer:

- Museums could potentially view this as a way of stealing off them as users don't have to pay the entry fee to look around the place.
- However you could argue that simply a "virtual tour" doesn't compare to seeing the real sights in person, so it may actually entice more people to go see it in real life.
- Street view also allows people to see the pedestrians who happened to be walking around at the time of capture. As it is effectively impossible for google to be individually gathering people's permission to be filmed faces must be blurred out.
- Culturally, socially or legally people may want locations to only been seen in person, perhaps for privacy reasons. For instance people can request to blur out their home on Google Street view. Perhaps a certain business doesn't want the inside of their place to be visible as it may make it more easy to rob / scope out.
- Different countries would have differing privacy laws (i.e: EU, UK, US) and to ensure they are not breaking any legalities with such a huge undertaking might prove tricky, especially for things such as different states or counties having specific laws.
- Perhaps a religious place might be against the recording/capture of a place of holiness in their religion.
- Certain countries and cultures are very tightly packed, and it might be effectively impossible to capture street view data for very densely population areas; think busy cities or bustling suburban places.

## Question #4
**Between 2008 and 2010, a company that was gathering data for an online mapping system, using cars fitted with cameras and WiFi equipment, collected some information that was being transmitted on personal WiFi networks.**
**The company apologised for doing this and an investigation found that a small number of software developers had been responsible for adding this functionality to the mapping system data collection software.**

**In the context of this example, discuss:**
- How it was possible for this data to be collected.
- What steps the owners of the networks could have taken to prevent the data from being collected.
- What legal and ethical issues might have arisen as a result of collecting this data.
- What lessons the company might have learnt from the incident and how their practices might have changed as a result of it.

**In your answer you will be assessed on your ability to follow a line of reasoning to produce a coherent, relevant and structured response.**

Answer:

- Programs like WireShark allow you to do what is called "packet sniffing" where you effectively can intercept all network traffic being sent along a LAN network.
- Unprotected/unencrypted networks not using a security protocol like WEP or WPA2/3 can have their data collected by third parties and the owners of these networks.
- While people who work in cybersecurity or white hat hackers might use these for legitimate purposes like pen-testing, this company had managed to do this for no (good) reason on actual people who are legally protected under law against this.
- Under the *Investigatory Powers Act of 2016* it is illegal to intercept network or any communication in any sort of way without explicit permission from whoever.
- On the ethical hand, assuming full legality, it is technically at the fault of the network owner to be hosting an unprotected Wi-Fi network.
- The company should be taking steps to avoid this happening in the future might want to consider being entirely 100% self hosted and non-cloud based, or to hire a cybersecurity professional to "diagnose" any issues prior to release.
	- Or they could have a MAC address whitelist for only their devices to be allowed to transmit to/from.
	- Or they could entirely rework their system to run locally and not be network reliant.
