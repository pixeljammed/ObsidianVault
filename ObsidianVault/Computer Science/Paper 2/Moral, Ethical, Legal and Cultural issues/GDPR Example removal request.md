Hi, around a year or two ago my mum was featured in an article (which I can no longer find online) which has been mirrored to the site pressreader.com.

I would like to request for my name and personal details to be removed from this article, and for you to give them legal permission to do so as well (as they state they cannot do without publisher's approval)
Article: I was diagnosed with autism at 44.URL: [282230899150911](https://pressreader.com/uk/daily-express/20220307/282230899150911)
Published: 7th March 2022Pages 3 to end (I believe)I would also like the family photo to be redacted.
Reasoning:I was a minor at the time of publication and cannot have fully consented to being written about.The article discusses health conditions, which should be private information.I only would like the personally identifyingÂ information to be removed, not the full article.Identification:Milo TekchandaniAge 16milotek07@gmail.com07745 011538Baldock(Can provide more if needed)
Thank you very much,Milo
