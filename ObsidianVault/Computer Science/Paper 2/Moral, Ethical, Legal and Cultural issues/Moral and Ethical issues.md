Morals and ethics are extremely similar but there are a few differences.
You could lose a few marks over these so it's worth reading!

## Differences
- ### Moral
	- A moral issue is one that concerns our **own** personal behavior and what we **ourselves** think is right / wrong.
	- We learn our moral values from other people, i.e: our **parents**, **friends**, **teachers**, and from experience.

- ### Ethical
	- **Ethics**, on the other hand, vary only slightly.
	- Ethics are what we as a society try to define as morally wrong.
	- For example in schools we try teach kids good morals, like **how all races and genders are equal** for example - but of course not everyone thinks this way (sadly) because everyone has their own morals.


> [!HINT] KEYWORD
> **Ethical issues:** factors that define the set of moral values by which society functions.

There are said to be "no rights and wrongs" with morals and ethics, as all issues are a matter of personal opinion. Some people argue that even actions that are illegal might still be ethical

At A-level you need to be aware of the [[Moral and Ethical issues]] presented within society.
