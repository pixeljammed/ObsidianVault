## Edward Snowden + WikiLeaks
In 2013, whistleblower **Edward Snowden** leaked thousands of secret documents revealing that **GCHQ** and the **NSA** (American National Security Agency) were collecting **literally millions of records** every day about phone calls made to, from or within the US.

He said “*I don’t want to live in a world where everything that I say, everything I do, everyone I talk to, every expression of creativity or love or friendship is recorded…*”

Snowden is currently residing in Russia, after being granted Russian citizenship by none other than Vladimir Putin himself. He went there after fleeing the USA under threat of jail-time for **espionage**.

## Questions

**Is the freedom of information act all costs realistic?**
- Sort of - to balance the government's transparency with the protection of people's privacy is hard, especially when there's a lot of cyber-crime.

**How much privacy / spying on British citizens would you accept as justifiable giving international terrorist threats?**
- For me I would probably only like them to be able to access publicly available information i.e: on public social media platforms that any regular personnel could find through searching means like google.

**Do you accept the ISC’s plans to hold public sessions as a fair way for the public to gain confidence into the workings of the intelligence agencies?**
- No - I think that it's simply a way to tide off people from complaining further and is mostly bullcrap. But alas what can you do? Even if they did have good intentions it is very hard to gain the trust of those already skeptical.

**Where do you feel the line should be drawn?**
- I think everyone is entitled to their own personal data and privacy, and if something is not explicitly posted publicly (i.e: private messages) I think it should stay private. For instance I don't agree with the government being able to read private messages of users by legal request - I think it 

**Is it in fact legal to collect this information?**
- Yes, for a lot of companies operating under UK law, certain information (including private info) can be retrieved by the UK's law enforcement through 


**In 2014, Rights groups have brought a case against GCHQ claiming that mass surveillance of the Internet by intelligence agencies violated human rights. See [UK Mass Surveillance Laws Human Rights Tribunal GCHQ](http://theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/05/uk-mass-surveillance-laws-human-rights-tribunal-gchq)**

**What are the challenges facing legislators who want to change the law to allow the government to continue its hacking activities?**
- It is very difficult, as I said before, to gain the trust of the public, while it is much more easier to *lose* their trust. To balance the transparency of the government so that your citizens' trust, you while also being able to access enough information to prevent crime (if that's really what they want that info for!), is a hard challenge for lawmakers.

**What are the challenges facing those who oppose changes to the law?**
- It is very hard for them to do anything about it - they could protest or try challenge it but there is not really much for them to do - they either deal with it effectively or move countries to one with more privacy-focused laws, which is a very big thing to do for a simple privacy law change.

**What are the risks and benefits of changes to privacy laws? See [GCHQ Hacking Legal Secret Change](http://wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-05/18/gchq-hacking-legal-secret-change-in-law).**
- They could both take and give us privacy as citizens.
- If they gave us *more privacy*, we would probably be more trusting and feel private in our digital activity, but it may allow more criminals online to slip through the cracks and remain uncaught.
- At the same time *less privacy* would probably be a bit outrageous for many and would cause a lot of uproar/backlash from the public, but maybe we'd catch more illegal activity this way.
