## Introduction
- Tech companies are notorious for their collection of user's personal data, and in a lot of cases, their **misuse**, **privacy breaches**, and **selling** of it.
- Most companies collect data on an ongoing basis and much of it is personal.
	-  For an example Google and Facebook collect tons of data on their users, tracking how long they might spend on a page, what sort of food you search for the most, for statistical / advertisement purposes.
- At a basic level this might be name and address information, but may also include data on people's **finance**, **health**, **relationship status**, **family**, **employment history**, and even their **personal views**.

## Issues
- **Personal privacy** - people have a right to privacy (think [[GDPR]]) and people might not have explicitly consented for this data to be collected that they might want private.
- **Data security** - organisations, even big ones like Sony and Facebook and [Rockstar Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_theft_auto_vi#:~:text=impacted.%5B68%5D-,September%202022%20leak,-On%2018%20September) get hacked and user data is leaked alongside.
- **Misuse of Data** - companies might illegally use data for **unethical** or even **illegal** purposes; like selling it for £££.
- **"Big Brother"** - many people believe that this data collected on them is being used by governments to monitor individuals *(TRUE)* and that that this is a breach of our human rights.
- **Online Profile** - Things posted online will stay there for a long time and can be traced back to you. 
- **Profiling** - certain organisations like [Whitepages.com](https://whitepages.com/) can collect user data together and profile complete details about an induividual.
