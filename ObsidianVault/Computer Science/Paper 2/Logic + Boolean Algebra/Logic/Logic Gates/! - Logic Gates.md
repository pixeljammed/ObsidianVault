## The 6 main logic gates
- The 6 gates studied within this unit are:
	- **NOT**
	- **AND**
	- **OR**
	- **XOR**
	- **NAND**
	- **NOR**

- Each of these can be represented by a drawable symbol

| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

NAND


| **A**   | **B**   | **Q**   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |

OR


| **A**   | **B**   | **Q**   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |
