- A full adder is similar to a [[Half Adders]] but has an **additional input**, allowing for a carry in to be used.
- Because the full adder has a carry input, the circuits can be âˆ« to form what's known as a [[Ripple Adder]].
- At each stage, B and Cin can be connected to the previous adder's S and Cout, and a new input can be attached to A.
