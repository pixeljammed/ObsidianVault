A transistor is a fundamental component in computer science, serving as a building block for electronic circuits.

An electrical circuit can either be **on** or **off**, like in [[Boolean Logic]]

It functions as a switch, controlling the flow of electrical current through it. In digital circuits, transistors are used to represent and manipulate binary states (0s and 1s), enabling the implementation of logic gates and memory elements. 

Transistors play a crucial role in modern computing systems, contributing to the development of integrated circuits and enabling the miniaturization and advancement of electronic devices.
