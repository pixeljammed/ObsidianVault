*Named after British logician Augustus De Morgan, these two laws of Boolean algebra come in incredibly useful when simplifying expressions.*

-----

> [!NOTE] De Morgan's law can be remembered as: 
> ## `Break the bar and change the sign.`
> Where **“the bar”** refers to an overline representing the `NOT` operation and **“the sign”** refers to changing between `+ (OR) and • (AND)`.

> De Morgan’s law can also be applied in reverse, by changing the sign and building the bar
