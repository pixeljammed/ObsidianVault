A database is an organised collection of data, designed to support efficient storage/retrieval, organisation and maintenance.

-----

Database Management Software (DBMS): software that allows for ease of access and management of a database, for example changing or deleting data inside.

A DBMS provides:
- A **language** to access and manipulate the data.
- **Data Integrity**: that the data is accurate and consistant.
- **Data Security**: a permission system to ensure only certain users have access.
- **Concurrency:** what happens when two users access the same item of data?

The model will aim to reduce **data redundancy**: one item of data stored in one place, too.
If this is not done the database will corrupt.
