WebSocket is better suited for low-latency communications/requests, as it has a persistant connection and does not require the request/handshake system HTTP has.

Create, Read, Update, Delete

**Create** could be when a tickets are created for the concert (or initialized)
**Read** when tickets are counted to see how many are reservations are avaliable
**Update** when ticket details are changed i.e: address is updated
**Delete** for instance is the ticket is cancelled/refunded or if they accidentally create too many tickets than reservations

| POST                | **Create**         |

Thin client architecture would allow the clients to be managed by a centralised server as most of their functionality would be hosted off there. This means that updates could be served and installed from this centralised server too.

1. JSON is more human-readable
2. JSON is more compact (smaller file size) and typically faster to parse.
