A **FQDN** is the complete domain name that specifies a hostâ€™s exact location in the DNS hierarchy.

Example:  `www.example.com.`

- `www` - Hostname (specific server/service, in this case, the [[World Wide Web]])
- `example` - Second-level domain (SLD)
- `.com` - Top-level domain (TLD)
- `.` - (trailing dot): Implies the DNS root (often omitted)

Why is it important, you ask?
- It's the **complete address** of a domain
- Uniquely identifies a server or resource
- It's used in networking, SSL certificates, and server configurations
