A **gateway** is a network device that serves as the **entry and exit point** between two different networks, such as a local network (LAN) and the internet (WAN), or between networks using different protocols.

In home networks, the **router often acts as the gateway**, connecting your local network to the internet through the ISP.

### Key Functions:
- **Protocol conversion**: Translates data between different network protocols.
- **Traffic regulation**: Manages and routes traffic between internal (private) and external (public) networks.
- **ISP Connection**: In many setups, the router acts as the gateway, meaning it connects the local network to the ISP, facilitating communication between your home network and the internet.
- **Security**: Can include firewall functionality, controlling what data enters and exits the network.
