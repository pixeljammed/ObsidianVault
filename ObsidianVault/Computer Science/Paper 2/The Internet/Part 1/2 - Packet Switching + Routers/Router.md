A **router** is a networking device that forwards data packets between different networks, typically connecting a local network (LAN) to the internet (WAN). It directs traffic based on IP addresses, ensuring that data reaches its correct device in the local network.

Home routers connect your devices to the internet by directing traffic between your local network and your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

## Functions:
- **Packet forwarding**: Routes data between devices and networks.
- **Network segmentation**: Divides large networks into smaller, manageable ones. *This also means you can connect multiple networks together through the use of routers.*
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Translates private IP addresses to a public IP address for internet access.
- **Modem** *(sometimes)* The router often connects directly to the ISPâ€™s modem (or has a built-in modem) to provide internet access to devices on the local network.
