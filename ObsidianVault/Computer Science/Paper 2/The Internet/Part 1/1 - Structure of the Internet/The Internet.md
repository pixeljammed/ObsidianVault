Computers communicate with each other using networks.
The internet, is effectively, one big network.

## The Internet
The internet is a network of **inter**connected **net**works.

The World Wide Web (the `www.` before [[Domain]]) is a collection of resources accessed via the internet. This is the bit responsible for hosting everyone's favourite sites like [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) or [Twitter](https://x.com) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/).
