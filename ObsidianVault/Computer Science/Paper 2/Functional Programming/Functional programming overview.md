Languages like C#, Python and Java are **imperative**, which means you tell the computer a clear sequence of tasks to perform.

Functional programming on the other hand, is **declarative**, which means:
- You tell the computer what stuff *is*.
- You construct programs by applying and composing functions

## History
*(not on spec, don't need to remember)*

- Functional programming has its roots in **Lambda Calculus**, which was invented by [Alonzo Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alonzo_church) in the 1930s.
- At a similar time, Moses Schönfinkel and Haskell Curry developed combinatory logic.
- **1958:** John McCarthy developed LISP
- **1960’s:** Landin’s Iswim and Iverson’s APL develop the paradigm
- **1970:** John Backus gives Turing Award lecture on FP
- **1980:** Haskell developed at the University of Glasgow as an open source Functional Programming language.
- **1990's-2000's:** Functional Programming continues to increase in popularity with newer languages like Erlang, Scala, and Clojure all growing

## Advantages + Disadvantages
#### Advantages
1. Conciseness: Often easier to read and maintain.
2. Easy Debugging: Thanks to the [[Characteristics of Functional Programming#Purity of Functions|statelessness / immutability]] of functional programming, we only need to observe the values pass
3. Easy to test code:
