Hello! I am a proud Y13 student currently studying my Computer Science, Maths and English A-levels in Cambridge, and for as long as I have known, loved everything about technology. 

I was first introduced to the power of computers by my father, and with his encouragement, I found a natural interest in them and their capabilities. By the age of 9 I had taught myself Python, and by 12 I could program sufficiently in 5 different languages! Since then I have gone on to create mobile apps, games, hardware projects, all of which viewable on my personal website / portfolio. I've tutored others, contributed to FOSS, taken courses, studied for qualifications (ISC^2, AWS) and took work experience at CHQ architects, all in relation to computer science.

In addition to my studies, in my spare time I enjoy numerous hobbies. Digital art, cooking, drumming and swimming are very enjoyable to me.

Recently I went to an MBDA early careers fair with my close friend where I spoke to happy + informative people about the Software Engineering degree apprenticeship there. I even spoke to the head of cybersecurity (Marcus), who happened to work with my father 10 years ago at Lockheed Martin by chance!
