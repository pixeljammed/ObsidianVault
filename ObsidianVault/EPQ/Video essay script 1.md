**[Introduction]** Hello, my name is Milo Tekchandani, and for my Extended Project Qualification, I decided to create a universal, wordless video game. The goal of my project was to maximize accessibility so that almost anyone, regardless of their background, age, or ability, could play the game.

**[Project Decision]** The decision to create a universal video game stemmed from my belief that gaming should be inclusive. The idea of a "universal" game was intriguing to me because it suggests that anyone—whether they speak a different language, have visual impairments, or are hearing-impaired—could enjoy the same gaming experience without barriers.

I wanted to create something that went beyond just being accessible; I wanted it to be truly universal. The internet has connected people from diverse cultures, and I’ve always been fascinated by how these connections can transcend traditional boundaries. I saw this project as a way to create something from an entirely different, 

**[Project Aims]** The primary aim of my project was to design a video game that adhered to the following principles:

1. **Accessibility:** Ensure the game could be played by people with various physical abilities and disabilities.
2. **Cultural Neutrality:** Avoid any content that could be misinterpreted or inaccessible due to cultural differences.
3. **Simplicity in Design:** Focus on intuitive gameplay that doesn’t rely on language or complex instructions.n

These aims were intentionally broad to give me the creative freedom to explore different aspects of game design while staying focused on making the game accessible and universal.

**[Time Management]** Time management was a crucial aspect of this project. I began by outlining a timeline with key milestones, such as completing the initial concept, research phases, and development cycles. Regularly updating this timeline helped me stay on track and allowed me to allocate enough time to the more challenging aspects of the project, such as coding and testing.

**[Progress Logging]** Throughout the project, I kept a detailed log of my progress. This included everything from initial sketches of game ideas to feedback received during playtesting. Maintaining this log was essential, as it allowed me to reflect on the development process and adjust my approach when necessary.

**[Research]** For my research, I divided my investigation into five key areas:

1. **General Game Design:** Understanding fundamental principles of game design, such as player engagement and game mechanics.
2. **Inclusivity:** Researching how to make games inclusive for players from different backgrounds.
3. **Game Development:** Learning about the tools and software needed to create the game.
4. **Accessibility:** Exploring best practices for making games accessible to people with disabilities.
5. **Language:** Investigating how language influences gameplay and how to create a game that transcends linguistic barriers.

For my primary research, I conducted a survey to gather insights from potential players. The survey asked questions about their gaming habits, preferences, and any accessibility needs they might have. This feedback was invaluable in shaping the final design of my game.

**[Planning]** Planning was another critical element. After gathering my research, I created a detailed plan that outlined each step of the development process, from initial design to final testing. This plan helped me stay organized and ensured that I didn’t overlook any important aspects of the project.

**[Development]** The development phase was both challenging and rewarding. I began by creating a basic prototype, which allowed me to test different game mechanics and accessibility features. I then iterated on this prototype based on feedback from testers, making improvements to the gameplay and user interface. The absence of language in the game meant I had to rely heavily on visual cues and intuitive design to guide players.

**[Outcome]** The final outcome of my project is a fully functional, wordless video game that I believe achieves the goals I set out. The game is accessible to a wide audience, and feedback from initial playtesting has been positive. Players from different backgrounds and with different abilities were able to enjoy the game without any significant barriers.

**[What I Have Learned and What I Would Do Better]** This project taught me a lot about the complexities of game design and the importance of accessibility in digital media. If I were to do this project again, I would spend more time on user testing with a broader range of participants. This would allow me to further refine the game’s accessibility features and ensure it meets the needs of an even wider audience.**[Introduction]** Hello, my name is Milo Tekchandani, and for my Extended Project Qualification, I decided to create a universal, wordless video game.
