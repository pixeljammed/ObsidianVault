## Gameplay

The game takes place within a single, large level - open world *(because the poll determined it was a popular genre)*, but with a twist. The world stems from bottom to the top

If you've ever played [Getting Over It](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/getting_over_it_with_bennett_foddy/) or [Only Up!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/only_up!) (a game now deleted), it has similar gameplay 

As the player progress up the level, they are at a constant risk of losing some or all of their progress; there are no checkpoints + **cannot save their progress**. The player must reach the top to win/beat the game, and the level is made precariously like an obstacle course out of floating objects + islands

The player navigates by jumping and moving using WASD + their mouse.

##### Design Tenets
- The player starts at the bottom of a tall, long journey upwards.
- The player must reach the top of the world to win.
- As the player progress up the level, they are at constant risk of losing some or all of their progress
- **All progress is permanent.** The player cannot reload a save if they fail and cannot choose to save *(autosaves)*

## Graphics
The game will be made within **Godot 3.5**, an engine limited graphically (somewhat) as it's a relatively new engine in comparison to the big name ones (think unity or unreal)

### Aesthetics / Stylisation
The art style will be akin to indie games such as:
- [World Of Goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_of_goo)
- [Karlson](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1228610/karlson/)
- [Roblox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roblox)

It will be simple and basic for ease of creation and the level will consist almost entirely out of geometrical primitives.

The game's aesthetics and art direction is like a homage to pop culture - it should include many references and funny, niche, internet jokes.

*The earliest test - here you can see me running and looking about, jumping, crouching, falling...**These are some quick scenes I made in **Godot 3.5** to test how places might look or feel.

## Story

### Setting
The game is set within a nondescript weird part of the world. It bears no resembelence to real life and has floating objects mish-mashed around.


### Storyline / Storyboard:
##### Opening
The game starts in an elevator going upward, with calm (royalty-free!) muzak playing. After a while a narrator juts in over the speakers and starts narrating off a script, albeit very clumsily, skipping over terms and conditions,
##### Main Gameplay Loop 
The player will climb up various obstacles and jump from place to place, while every now and then a narrator could talk to the player and stir things up.
##### Ending
The game ends when the player reaches the summit, and a cutscene will play congratulating the player in a comedically anti-climatic way.
