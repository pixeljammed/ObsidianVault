Think back to the stone age - the beginning of when computers were invented - the dawn of the modern age. If you, like my parents, were born pre-2000, then you can probably recall a hearing about if not playing yourself a much more primitive video games than the ones we're familiar with now.

Maybe you weren't familiar with the classics if you (like me) didn't grow up in that time - or were not fortunate enough to have experienced them.

## Why am I choosing to be wordless?
It's not about being wordless *per-se*, it's more about accessibility. I have plenty of friends from around the world, some of which cannot speak very good english or read it, 

It would also make selling it easier and cheaper. Without different languages to translate into the potential market + playerbase could be effectively almost everyone, as I don't have to go into the effort to translate the entire game into different langauges.

## Why a videogame?

**Video games mean a lot to me.**
I've known my best friends for 14y+ and in 2018 they moved away. Ever since that happened I made sure to keep in touch with then, through playing videogames together.
Every weekend we call each other in a group of about 8 of us, and we play for a few hours.

We still see each other at least 6 or so times a year, and go on holidays together, but I'm almost certain that if we didn't do that, we would not be nearly as close.

But there are other wordless / "universal" pieces of media too. Like illustration-only books, and silent films (which still come out, they aren't just a thinf of the past). Why a videogame?
They mean a lot to me, as silly as it might sound, and have helped me bond with many of my friends and family.
