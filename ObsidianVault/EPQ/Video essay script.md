My name is Milo Tekchandani and I have been working on a playable experience as part of my EPQ artifact.  

**Explanation**
You might wonder what I mean by a "universal" video game, and to put simply it is a game that almost anyone of any background, age, or ability can play. For example, someone who can only speak Spanish, someone who has trouble seeing, even someone who is completely deaf.

A better way to say it is accessibility, but I think the term "universal" seems more interesting.

**Project Aims**
My aim with the project is kind of vague but can be loosely defined in X rules.
- Create a video-game

**Reasoning for choice**
My reasoning for choosing this project is because I believe people are more connected now than ever thanks to the internet. The online is home to thousands of different communities and languages and news from world-wide, and over the years I've met many people from different cultures and origins 

It would also make selling it easier and cheaper. Without different languages to translate into the potential market + player base could be effectively almost everyone, as I don't have to go into the effort to translate the entire game into different languages.

However, profit's not one of my goals for this project, and I would like to release it free-of-charge, downloadable and sharable by whoever wishes.

## Research

- General Game Design
- Inclusivity
- Game Development
- Accessibility
- Language

While for my primary research I conducted a survey on
