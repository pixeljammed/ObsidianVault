Oh to be young again - naive, untested, never knowing of hardship... what a life we had - and speaking of it, I raise you a question: What would your younger self think of you?

I'll let you ponder on that and tell you something rather stupid instead - for my 14th birthday (among another things) me and my 3 childhood best friends went to a soft play area in Sweden. Granted, we be bc didn't know it was a soft play area but we still went on it. Apparently Swedish people hate the things because it was a ghost town - more employees present than paying customers - take that as you will. However I found myself having really good fun the entire time. We just played tag for ages and then proceeded to just run around for the hell of it. It's a little embarrassing to admit this but honestly, I've done worse in life so oh well.

My point being here is that I don't see why are these inherently fun things reserved solely for the young ones - there is an invisible threshold of judgement bestown on us that nobody seemingly cares for. Past a certain, unspoken age it's shunned to do these things, it's childish even. 

Almost everyone I have asked from my old school misses primary - longs to go back just for a day to relive the greatness when our hardest homework was double digit multlipication and lunchtimes we all played manhunt. Why does nobody play manhunt anymore? Because people think it's stupid l

If you ask me, people need to live a little more - stop having boring parties where you drink and that's about the end of the fun. I mean I like them as much as the next 16 year old but SURELY there are better things to do that mix fanta and vodka together - no that is not a cocktail. 
Sounds a little silly to suggest but maybe we should organize dumb things - there's more to life than drinking you know. 
Go to the park at night and play tag with your mates. Climb a damn tree, hell if I know, I just think sometimes we miss out on fun just for the sake of being "mature". Maybe you can integrate drinks into this if you really cared, I don't know.

Call me childish, sure, call me whatever, alright, but a little bit of fun never hurt anyone.
