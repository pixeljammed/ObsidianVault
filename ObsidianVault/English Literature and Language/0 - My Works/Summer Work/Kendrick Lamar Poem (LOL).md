## Kendrick Lamar

In Compton born and raised
K DOT wrote all day
20 years later to sing about his past
To leave it all behind, which album will be his last

Concrete jungles under the sun
When he was young
Inspired by his father, his own tales
Stories of crime that ended up in jail

His glad for a life he didn't have to live
Driven by success and desire not to give
up, nor be sentenced in a trial
All awhile he talks about a hood

Stories of the past of both bad and the good
His first debut, his big break stemming from them.
California - Compton, a place lined with scum, so gritty
Great mixed within bad, a good kid in a mad city.
