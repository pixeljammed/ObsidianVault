 In the first article the writer expresses his thoughts toward the modern day, digitalized news and media. To him it seems that in fair comparison to the old days the new age of news seems to be designed to encourage user interaction, almost deliberately written and formatted to spark discussion - for better or worse. The author believes that digital communication has worsened the way we talk with one another - disrespect and insulting common and for that reason opts to disable comments under his posts to avoid the potential storm of toxicity.

He likes that the old format of traditional newspapers still exist - in paper format, the “old” way like how it was when he started.

Brooker begins by directly addressing his readers - saying that some of the more attentative of them, or “eagle-eyed” as he puts it, may have noticed something. He then goes on to say that there are “exits all over the building” in regards to his articles, implying as if they could stop reading at a whim - they are not forced against will to read them. At the same time this also illustrates his article as if it were a speech given by him in a physical location (hence “building” and his readers are his audience by listening.

Mr Birrell, on the other hand, starts on a positive note, as if to highlight the good going on in our world presently and then contrasts this with a juxtaposing view - on how the disabled are being treated worser, maybe not as a result but like they are being forgotten - a minority

He ends it on a bittersweet note by saying how good it is that we are treating others with the respect they deserve but also that we should be remembering of all those whomst may be.

Charlie Brooker uses a wide array of language conventions, to almost a humerous extent. Things like the use of satire and neologism convey a more informal tone of article as if he's speaking directly to you casually, whilst Ian Brooker tends to leans toward the more factual and arguable "traditional" approach - presenting facts and letting the reader garner them and form a view on their own - although he is not completely removed from the article, and his opinion is clear.

Charlie Brooker has written about a less serious topic which could be the reasoning for this difference but also context is important here. Mr Brooker in the past has written comedies and sketches for the BBC and this is reflected in his style of writing here too - i.e: the constant use of humor/informal register.

All the while, Mr Birrel, as evidenced by his past in writing articles towards more global issues and politically concerning topics makes sense on why he uses a more serious and formal tone in contrast.
