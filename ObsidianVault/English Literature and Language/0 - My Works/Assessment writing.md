A reminder of the assessment objectives:
- AO1 - Apply concepts and methods from integrated linguistic and literary study, suing **terminology** and coherent written expression
- **Analyse** ways in which meaning are shaped in texts
- Demonstrate understanding of the significance of **contexts** and which texts are produced and received.
- **Explore connections** across texts, informed by linguistic and literary concepts and methods.
-----
## Good structure

- Open with a comparative topic sentence which addresses the question. This is your AO4. For example:
	- *"Both Fitzgerald and Larkin are interested in the discrepancy between individuals perceptions of love in their past  and the reality of love which they learn."*
- After your topic sentence; go for **AO2 - Analysis** and **AO1 - Terminology**, but weave your comparison through the paragraph.
	- *In love songs in age *
- After your analysis, you can address **AO3 - Context**.
	- *Gatsby's attempt to retrieve his past*
- Your final sentence can return to the question with an AO4 - Summative
	- *Both writers present us with an experience of love and relationships as inextricably linked with disillusionment and loss, indicative of the writers' own attitudes to their cultural contexts - Fitzgerald's disillusionment as part of the Lost Generation and Larkin's sense of regret as part of The Movement.*
