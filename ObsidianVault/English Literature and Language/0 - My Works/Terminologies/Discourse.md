Discourse refers to the how a text is structured / formatted overall.

-----
#### Discourse markers
**Words that mark boundaries or changes in discourse.**
- For an example:
	- *"therefore..."*
	- *"however..."*
	- *"moreover..."*
- These can help **present** and **organize** the argument. 
- You could use it to mark a conversational switch.
- In spontaneous speech these could be more casual, like "well" or "so" or "anyway".

#### Cohesion
**The way the text is linked together, and is "whole".**
- For instance in Gatsby, the whole story can be linked together.
	- You can make backlinks to previous chapters/events.
	- Themes like capitalism and contradiction, arrogance are  a **constant throughout** the book.
	- Ex: Gatsby as a character is not revealed instantaneously, instead a sense of voice is used as many characters reveal information about him, presenting him as mythical.
		- i.e: Rumors about him killing a man or being a spy.
		- Foreshadowing his future.
- Another example might be the repetition of anything. 
- Use of pronouns
- Use of [[Terminology#Ellipsis|Ellipsis]] **(the three dots) ...**

#### Ellipsis
**The deliberate removal of words, maybe for clearness's sake.**
- Ellipsis can be used to keep the reader's pace at the same as the thoughts of a character's. *For example:*
	- In speech, `...` could indicate a voice trailing off.
	- And `-` could be a sudden stop.
	- Example: "*Oh wait- I thought you were Whittaker...*"
- Also in quoted or reported speech - "\[I'm] about to cum"

#### Intertextual referencs
**References to the same piece of text, maybe some earlier information.**


#### Anaphoric reference
**A feature of [[Terminology#Cohesion|cohesion]]. Where a pronoun is used in place in reference to something earlier.**
#### Cataphoric Reference
**The opposite to Anaphoric reference. Where a pronoun or noun points forward to something mentioned in the future.


> [!HINT] Anaphoric + Cataphoric references in The Great Gatsby
> - In Gatsby for example, "*he*" is used a lot when people talk about Gatsby when he's discussed.
> - This creates an alluring sense of mystery to him, as if his name is too "sacred" to be said like a mythical figure - adding to the mysterious and obscure persona of him built until his reveal in Chapter 4.
> - Even Nick chooses to withhold his name from us when they first speak - the pronoun being used instead.

## Mode + Register
#### Mode
**Mode is the medium in which we communicate.**
- **Written mode** (writing)
- **Spoken mode** (speech)
- **Visual mode** (image)

- Each mode may range from spontaneous, like **casual conversation** or a **scribbled note**, to planned, like a **speech** or **essay**.

#### Register
**The style or formality of writing.**
- Register is often referring to **formal vs informal** language.
- Register can also note the **specialised vs specialised** language. 
	- For example: **Law**, **medicine**, **educational** lanaguage.
- You'd expect an informal register to be used in natural speech or casual conversation, whereas a speech would probably be more formal in nature. 
- They may also use a specialist register depending on the target audience.

#### Standard English
**The form of grammar and vocabulary considered to be "standard in English society.**
- Like the English you are taught. Not including slang, etc.

-----
## Spoken Discourse
#### Utterance
**An interrupted chain of spoken language**
- Sort of like *enjambment*.

#### Turn-taking
**Process by which participants in conversations follow rules, cues etc. to ensure that they can be involved.**
- In Gatsby in Chapter 6
