- My first draft for my english NEA - fiction.
- The two sections are part of the same story, think of one as a prologue. Or something.
- Maybe, I should put the last paragraph (edited though) as the opening paragraph. It was that originally but I felt it didn't fit the overall gradual tone of the story, but it did make for a very interesting, hooking opening!

## Codependence
**1976**

It is midnight. A hill overlooks the city. A dark figure stands atop it, gazing down at the lights below. A cold wind whips at its cloak, but it does not seem to feel it.
A little, misshapen creature scrambles to the plateau with a rabid, feral energy. Keeping its gaze, the dark figure sustains his stare forward as it starts to speak in a gritty, abrasive voice. 

"These plans have finally reached fruition," a voice calls out from under the cowl. "Soon these people will know true selfishness."
The figure falls silent, so does the raspy breath of the creature adjacent. Fearful, the creature begins to hesitate, before uttering "...Is it time?".

The dark figure turns with the effort of a grindstone to face the creature. Under its hood, its face, a ghost-white mask of evil reveals itself through expression - twisting its mouth into a terrifying humourless grin. Its mouth contorts, and spits out a single, sour response. "Yes."

**1980**

It is surprising how much a place can change within a few years, as anyone living in a city like me will tell you, but my old town in New Orleans seemed to be a time capsule of a place long gone by. I'm not to complain, it felt warmly nostalgic, but it was as if time had accelerated past Elmsworth, leaving it wonderfully stagnant. 

Mum and Dad, as always, welcomed me home with open arms, their warm smiles a temporary balm to my unhappiness. Being fired is a horrid thing of course but I tentatively considered it a change well needed for me, maybe. The performing industry seems designed to actively annoy and frustrate the actors whose shoulders it rests on ironically, to the point of illness. My parents were certain I'd be alright in time - and were absolutely lovely to me as they always were.  We spent the evening catching up, talking about nothing in particular, and until it was dark we spoke about all sorts, and hugged, cried and slept as if there was anything else to do. I never considered Elmsworth to be full of luddites, albeit the technology (or lack thereof) felt like there was a general sentiment against modernity, a rare thing for me, and something I found nice and novel, to my bright surprise.

Come Sunday morning, I'd planned to meet up my old group from high school. We met at a small café near the centre of town, where the walls were plastered with pictures of old events and faded advertisements. I chalked it up to laziness or an attempt to keep up with the faux old-school style, but it was rather charming. The first to arrive was Sam, who looked almost exactly the same as I remembered, and equally funny as he'd always been. As we waited for the others, we made small talk - about my time in the city, his work at the local garage, and the usual mundane topics. I told him about ache-inducing mess in my last job, and he sympathised with my predicament, and said he'd be happy to help me get back up on my feet if things ever came to that.

The others arrived, and the conversation shifted. Frankly it was as if the group hadn't ever split, and my fondness of the small town life was fully realised in that moment. There is a great warmth in community I suppose, I still miss it partly. As the night flew by on, at one point someone said, and verbatim, "...you know, of course, except from the...*"surprise"*, even though it's been so long", and in an instant I felt the whole room sour.

Everyone fell silent - a taboo of some sort had been spoken on, and after a while I felt the need to address it.  "What's the... *surprise*?" I blurted, and at once all eyes were on me, cutting into me with the silence.  After what felt like forever, Sam started snorting and giggling with his always childish humour, and suddenly my genuine blunder was transformed into accidental comedy to my relief. The whole group burst out laughing and I considered myself fortunate to not look like a git.

After though, I knew not push the topic, but a cold knot of curiosity settled in my stomach. As we talked, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, after the mention of whatever the "surprise" was, they were now all playing a part of some sort.  Their laughter seemed too forced, their expressions just a touch too controlled. It was probably the business of being a performer convincing me of everyone being actors, was the reason invented in my head, and the uneasiness subsided after a while, but the unaddressed elephant of whatever this *surprise* was irked me, but I chose not to question.

After a few hours, I excused myself. There was something else I needed to do - pick up the last of my things from the theatre in the city where I used to work. A former coworker, Sarah, had come from our hometown as well a year after me, and I thought of all people, it'd be most appropriate to ask her - maybe she could shed some light.

The city felt like a different world, bustling with life and noise, a stark contrast to the quiet of my hometown. The theatre was just as I remembered it, and Sarah was happy to help me pack up, although torn by my leaving. "It's a shame really," she said through a gritted grin, as she hauled a box of throwing poles to my car, "Ethan had it coming, and now you're a hero to us, shame management *has* to fire you...".
When I mentioned the surprise to her however, she froze, her eyes wide with fear. The usual energetic demeanour on her face was gone, replaced with an expressionless slate.

After a while, she spoke. The conversation was almost entirely one-sided and her replies were more ungiving after the other.
“You don’t know?” she whispered, practically to herself. “It happened in 1977. In March. That's all you should know. Don’t ever ask about that in Elmsworth, okay? It's safer if you forget.”

I tried to press her for more, but she wouldn’t say anything else. Her hands trembled as she helped me pack my things, and with a coy bittersweet smile on my face I said goodbye. And I left the theatre in silence, with more questions than answers.

That night, back at my parents’ house, I couldn’t sleep. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, replaying the day’s events in my mind. What was this *surprise* that everyone seemed so afraid of? Why did the mere mention of it make people act out?

The next morning, I decided to find out for myself. During breakfast I brought it up, both mum and dad laughed and the conversation moved on, and I didn't question further but the uneasiness seeped further through. I still wanted to find out more, though and the local library was small but well-stocked, and I figured it was the best place to start. I arrived just after it opened, and the elderly librarian greeted me with a polite smile, though her eyes were sharp with curiosity as I asked about old newspapers from the late 70s.

“Looking for anything in particular?” she asked as she led me to the archives.

“Just some local news,” I replied, trying to sound casual. "Everything from 1977, if you can."

She hesitated for a moment before nodding slowly. “I see. Well, let me know if you need any help. It's sorted by year, lucky for you." she retorted before trodding away.

I spent hours combing through the dusty newspapers, scanning headlines and articles until I found what I was looking for - a small piece about the town planning a "surprise" for an old hermit who lived on the outskirts, just up on the hill. The article mentioned that he was turning 90, and that the townspeople were planning something special for him. It didn’t go into much detail, but something about it made my skin crawl. The article was written by a journalist who, according to the library records, never wrote another piece after that one.

Shocked, I was about to read more, when I felt a startling, tight grip on my shoulder. The librarian from before had appeared beside me, her eyes wide and frantic as they locked onto the paper in my hands. Her skin seemed to pale, and her grip on my arm was unnaturally strong for someone her age. 

She tilted her head down in a vile glare
“You can't be reading that,” she hissed, her voice low and trembling.

Before I could respond, a sharp, piercing whistle that echoed through the building emanated from her. I faced her, and then her features began to contort in bulbous cuts, and I looked up to see other people in the library turning toward us, their movements jerky and wrong. Their skin looked blue, almost rotten, and they stood up, and they paced towards me in a foul, slow manner like a school of sleeper agents being activated. It was as if their joints had been turned to stone, and limbs cast in a thick layer of rust - they moved slow and firm in a hellish manner.

I yanked my arm free and bolted for the door, not daring to look back as I heard the librarian’s call behind me, joined by the inhuman cry of the others. I ran through the streets, raced past buildings, my breath coming in uneven ragged gasps. 
When I finally dared to glance over my shoulder, I saw them - a horde of things, like walking corpses, like serpentines, inching towards my direction stiffly. It seemed a great effort for them to move, their features were outstretched and inorganic, taken straight from a cliche snuff movie. Like crudely drawn beasts turned to life, they moved in horrible uniform ways, all creatures so primitive, hands and legs slipping, scraping over tarmac.

I looked back forward. I ran and ran and ran and I didn’t stop running until I reached the city hours later, collapsing in a heap on the pavement, gasping for air. And I remember my mind was numbed, unable to process anything around me. Police took me in as someone called to report a collapsed person outside their home on the edge of the suburb, and soon I was in a room with a few state officials. I was instructed to tell nobody; I would get a large insurance payout; I was to live a modest life.

Now as I write this, the events replay in my mind like a nightmare, as they have done every night since that day. The feeling waxes and wains but never really leaves my mind. I have lived in the city, with my Sarah, the only person I trust, since. She's watched me grow bitter, god bless her soul, and I love her.
17 years on, I don't want to return, but the unknowing feeling has never stopped. As if it were a phantom pain - an itch never satiated, a curiosity never quelled, it refuses to be rid of me ultimately.

Back in 1980, I went through something I was unable to talk about for years of my life. I was paid a great, extortionate amount to keep my silence on the events.
It's not called Elmsworth anymore - you won't find it on a map or online. It's there for certain though, and I'm going to pay a visit one more time before I go. Maybe I can be a pretender.
