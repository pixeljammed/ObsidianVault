Provide a detailed overview of your fiction piece's plot.

## Genre, Audience, and Purpose
The genre of my fiction text is **Short Story**

**Describe your target audience.**
- My target audience is assumably people my age, so, young adult readers. 
- Additionally, people who might be interested in short stories 

**Explain the purpose of your fiction piece.**
- Ultimately, for entertainment and maybe to scare the reader a little.
## Link to Shared Theme
My fiction piece ties into the theme of [[Shared theme|identity]] well - the story is about "body snatchers", and having your identity stolen away from you in effect, being replaced by a different conscious, mimicking you.

Body snatchers have an obvious tie to this theme, and like I say below, one trying to "fit in" to seem human sort of relates to me. I was diagnosed rather mild autism in 2018 and while I find thrive socially, I tend to significantly more comfortable at my own home. In some social situations I used to feel like I might not fit in with a group and get antsy.

## Characters
There is an unnamed protagonist - the story is told from his perspective (first person). He is a freelance journalist who writes about "hidden gems" in throughout the state of Louisiana, presenting his articles on a personal blog *(I won't be writing as if it were a blog, however)*.

He will be returning to the town he has close ties to. I think the reason why this is so important is that after the reveal that the whole town could be almost entirely filled with body snatchers, it'd feel more personal. Perhaps he has family or close friends there and he'll have to question if they are even human!
## Setting
It is set in New Orleans, Louisiana, a small town in the USA. The influence for this location is the video game L4D2. There's no significance and it's a city, but helps ground the story.

Louisiana, unlike other states in America, does not have counties, but instead Parishes, which are very similar but have ties to Christianity and churches and have their own rules & laws.

Louisiana as a whole is a fairly quiet and irrelivant state. Recently it has been subject to tornados

## Themes
Throughout the story, events and people foreshadow to the reveal of most, if not all, of the town to be body-snatchers. The body snatchers mimic the personality & mannerisms of the people they inhabit, pretending to be "them".

Re-reading the story, reveals breadcrumbs alluding to the body-snatchers. For instance unnatural speech or action, like a poorly constructed mimicry of a human's social interaction. For an example, a weird saying - could be read as a moment of awkwardness, or later realised as a telltale sign that something is amiss. The short story should contain lots of these.

The body snatchers use a dogwhistle to identify each other, in a rather acute manner. This creates a potential for remaining humans to double bluff - and ironically mimic the bodysnatchers.
By the reveal, this flips the story on its head, leaving readers to question if the characters the protagonist speaks to really have been taken over, or simply humans in hiding.

This, ideally, should make them re-read the story, and possibly even pick up on the breadcrumbs mentioned before.

I know "body-snatchers" might be an overused trope but I think I can make it interesting. Normally paranormal stories tend to be of a close friend or family member in a stereotypical remote location like in the middle of the woods. A whole town populated by them takes a different approach, I believe, and lets me explore new, non-cliche ideas.

## Narrative Style and Perspective
Story is written in first person, and as if it were in the past.
