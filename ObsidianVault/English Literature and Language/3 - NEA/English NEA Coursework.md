## The Death of Creativity is Now

"Word vomit" is the best noun to describe the current way the current internet is heading towards being, if you'd ask me.

Yes really, the internet. The beautiful thing full of love, hate and online discourse forums where you can bleed your heart out over multimedia, and chock full of others doing the same, is being subjected to a daily enshittification experimentation project only growing exponentially by the day. The world wide web's steady fall into the artificially-generated rubbish-bin continues, and it saddens me. "*The great equaliser*", as everyone hails it, is beginning to fail.

We are beginning to reach a point where real, organic arts like writing, art, music, video are about to class as a rare species. Go log in to social media. Just today, how many of those tweets you see do you think were *really* typed out key by key by an actual human, as opposed to bots? Click on Google images, search something - how many of the results are tagged as artificially created? Go on Spotify and it won't take you more than a minute to find songs that humans had no part in making, pushed to the front page by the corporation themself. 
Goodness, how many English essays being marked right now are composed by a "generative" AI?

Right now we're witnessing the modern-day-era equivalent of the tabloid. Short, sensationalistic, spam, and nothing more. *57.1% of All the Internet is AI Generated Slime, Researchers find*, rings a headline from just the beginning of this year. The paper is yet to be reviewed but really I have no doubt in this figure. Amazon, of all companies found that, in an effective ploy to immediately tarnish the vast landscape that is our web, we've already replaced well over half of it with AI slop - a figure predicted to grow to 90% by 2026.
I'm not going to boldly proclaim it to be the modern-day burning of the library of Alexandra, no. But you'd be outright stupid to think of this hellish information regurgitation machine as even remotely good.
You know, I'm no luddite - I love seeing new technology being put to great use. I've loved computers since I was a young'un but for crying out loud what actual purpose do nonsensical, hallucinated, words on a page do to benefit us?
Why are we so eager as a race to dry out characters, personas, identities in media through this? AI has no understanding of the wry, stupid humour riddled in irony found in writers. It has no one set of beliefs, no opinions synonymous with a certain radio or podcast host you might tune into and like. It can't come up with a new game idea nobody's ever thought of before. Right now, ChatGPT could not tell apart obvious sarcasm if you spelt it out to it. Hell ask any "large language learning model" (gosh - none of those words are in the bible!) how many letter Rs are in the word strawberry. You'll find mirthful humour in its lost confidence - honestly the only thing I'm jealous of it for.

While that the dopamine-fried generation that comes after us will be knowing to the pitfalls of AI. I can swear to the fact one of your elders have interacted, liked, commented on artificial content, taking it as real. If you have facebook you'll know what I'm banging on about. 10 years from now video evidence will be worthless in court thanks to fake, created, AI videos. Same with pictures. Same with everything. It's the misinformation heaven at your fingertips.

Honestly, I am both worried and hopeful. There's obviously a massive pushback online right now against artificial intelligence. And love it. I wonder if this is what *Rage Against the Machine* were on about. 
I think people will begin to appreciate humanity in writing more from now on. I think people will appreciate reviews, editing and articles like this more. The value of real, human-written text is going to only get more valuable in a sea of endlessly regenerating, growing spam - both to humans and the engineers training said AI. You can tell when a human has written something. ChatGPT or any alike have no concept of reoccurring inside jokes, how to listen to your readers, or any long term ways to retain their audience like a writer would. I think we will be alright, you know. After all, why would I bother to read something, that nobody even bothered to write? Why would you admire a painting nobody bothered to paint? Why listen to a song composed by no one? 
You tell me.

## Codependence

**1976**
It is midnight. A hill overlooks the city. A dark figure stands atop it, gazing down at the lights below. A cold wind whips at its cloak, but it does not seem to feel it.
A little, misshapen creature scrambles to the plateau with a rabid, feral energy. Keeping its gaze, the dark figure sustains his stare forward as it starts to speak in a gritty, abrasive voice. 

"These plans have finally reached fruition," a voice calls out from under the cowl. "Soon these people will know true selfishness."
The figure falls silent, so does the raspy breath of the creature adjacent. Fearful, the creature begins to hesitate, before uttering "...Is it time?".

The dark figure turns with the effort of a grindstone to face the creature. Under its hood, its face, a ghost-white mask of evil reveals itself through expression - twisting its mouth into a terrifying humourless grin. Its mouth contorts, and spits out a single, sour response. "Yes."



**1980**
It is surprising how much a place can change within a few years, as anyone living in a city like me will tell you, but my old town in New Orleans seemed to be a time capsule of a place long gone by. I'm not to complain, it felt warmly nostalgic, but it was as if time had accelerated past Elmsworth, leaving it wonderfully stagnant. 

Mum and Dad, as always, welcomed me home with open arms, their warm smiles a temporary balm to my unhappiness. Being fired is a horrid thing of course but I tentatively considered it a change well needed for me, maybe. The performing industry seems designed to actively annoy and frustrate the actors whose shoulders it rests on ironically, to the point of illness. My parents were certain I'd be alright in time - and were absolutely lovely to me as they always were.  We spent the evening catching up, talking about nothing in particular, and until it was dark we spoke about all sorts, and hugged, cried and slept as if there was anything else to do. I never considered Elmsworth to be full of luddites, albeit the technology (or lack thereof) felt like there was a general sentiment against modernity, a rare thing for me, and something I found nice and novel, to my bright surprise.

Come Sunday morning, I'd planned to meet up my old group from high school. We met at a small café near the centre of town, where the walls were plastered with pictures of old events and faded advertisements. I chalked it up to laziness or an attempt to keep up with the faux old-school style, but it was rather charming. The first to arrive was Sam, who looked almost exactly the same as I remembered, and equally funny as he'd always been. As we waited for the others, we made small talk - about my time in the city, his work at the local garage, and the usual mundane topics. I told him about ache-inducing mess in my last job, and he sympathised with my predicament, and said he'd be happy to help me get back up on my feet if things ever came to that.

The others arrived, and the conversation shifted. Frankly it was as if the group hadn't ever split, and my fondness of the small town life was fully realised in that moment. There is a great warmth in community I suppose, I still miss it partly. As the night flew by on, at one point someone said, and verbatim, "...you know, of course, except from the...*"surprise"*, even though it's been so long", and in an instant I felt the whole room sour.

Everyone fell silent - a taboo of some sort had been spoken on, and after a while I felt the need to address it.  "What's the... *surprise*?" I blurted, and at once all eyes were on me, cutting into me with the silence.  After what felt like forever, Sam started snorting and giggling with his always childish humour, and suddenly my genuine blunder was transformed into accidental comedy to my relief. The whole group burst out laughing and I considered myself fortunate to not look like a git.

After though, I knew not push the topic, but a cold knot of curiosity settled in my stomach. As we talked, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, after the mention of whatever the "surprise" was, they were now all playing a part of some sort.  Their laughter seemed too forced, their expressions just a touch too controlled. It was probably the business of being a performer convincing me of everyone being actors, was the reason invented in my head, and the uneasiness subsided after a while, but the unaddressed elephant of whatever this *surprise* was irked me, but I chose not to question.

After a few hours, I excused myself. There was something else I needed to do - pick up the last of my things from the theatre in the city where I used to work. A former coworker, Sarah, had come from our hometown as well a year after me, and I thought of all people, it'd be most appropriate to ask her - maybe she could shed some light.

The city felt like a different world, bustling with life and noise, a stark contrast to the quiet of my hometown. The theatre was just as I remembered it, and Sarah was happy to help me pack up, although torn by my leaving. "It's a shame really," she said through a gritted grin, as she hauled a box of throwing poles to my car, "Ethan had it coming, and now you're a hero to us, shame management *has* to fire you...".
When I mentioned the surprise to her however, she froze, her eyes wide with fear. The usual energetic demeanour on her face was gone, replaced with an expressionless slate.

After a while, she spoke. The conversation was almost entirely one-sided and her replies were more ungiving after the other.
“You don’t know?” she whispered, practically to herself. “It happened in 1977. In March. That's all you should know. Don’t ever ask about that in Elmsworth, okay? It's safer if you forget.”

I tried to press her for more, but she wouldn’t say anything else. Her hands trembled as she helped me pack my things, and with a coy bittersweet smile on my face I said goodbye. And I left the theatre in silence, with more questions than answers.

That night, back at my parents’ house, I couldn’t sleep. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, replaying the day’s events in my mind. What was this *surprise* that everyone seemed so afraid of? Why did the mere mention of it make people act out?

The next morning, I decided to find out for myself. During breakfast I brought it up, both mum and dad laughed and the conversation moved on, and I didn't question further, but the uneasiness seeped further through. I still wanted to find out more, though. The local library was small but well-stocked, and I figured it was the best place to start. I arrived just after it opened, and the elderly librarian greeted me with a polite smile, though her eyes were sharp with curiosity as I asked about some old newspapers.

“Looking for anything in particular?” she asked as she led me to the archives.

“Just some local news,” I replied. "Everything from 1977, if you can."

She hesitated for a moment before nodding slowly. “I see. Well, let me know if you need any help. It's sorted by year, lucky for you." she retorted before trodding away.

I spent hours combing through the dusty newspapers, scanning headlines and articles until I found what I was looking for - a small piece about the town planning a "surprise" for an old hermit who lived on the outskirts, just up on the hill. The article mentioned that he was turning 90, and that the townspeople were planning something special for him. It didn’t go into much detail, but something about it made my skin crawl. The article was written by a journalist who, according to the library records, never wrote another piece after that one.

Shocked, about to read more, I felt a startling, tight grip on my shoulder.
The librarian from before had appeared beside me, her eyes wide and frantic as they locked onto the paper in my hands. Her skin seemed to pale, and her grip on my arm was unnaturally strong for someone her age. 

She tilted her head down in a vile glare
“You can't be reading that,” she hissed, her voice low and trembling.

Before I could respond, a sharp, piercing whistle that echoed through the building emanated from her. I faced her, and then her features began to contort in bulbous cuts, and I looked up to see other people in the library turning toward us, their movements jerky and wrong. Their skin looked blue, almost rotten, and they stood up, and they paced towards me in a foul, slow manner like a school of sleeper agents being activated. It was as if their joints had been turned to stone, and limbs cast in a thick layer of rust - they moved slow and firm in a hellish manner.

I yanked my arm free and bolted for the door, not daring to look back as I heard the librarian’s call behind me, joined by the inhuman cry of the others. I ran through the streets, raced past buildings, my breath coming in uneven ragged gasps. 
When I finally dared to glance over my shoulder, I saw them - a horde of things, like walking corpses, like serpentines, inching towards my direction stiffly. It seemed a great effort for them to move, their features were outstretched and inorganic, taken straight from a cliche snuff movie. Like crudely drawn beasts turned to life, they moved in horrible uniform ways, all creatures so primitive, hands and legs slipping, scraping over tarmac.

I looked back forward. I ran and ran and ran and I didn’t stop running until I reached the city hours later, collapsing in a heap on the pavement, gasping for air. And I remember my mind was numbed, unable to process anything around me. Police took me in as someone called to report a collapsed person outside their home on the edge of the suburb, and soon I was in a room with a few state officials. I was instructed to tell nobody; I would get a large insurance payout; I was to live a modest life.

Now as I write this, the events replay in my mind like a nightmare, as they have done every night since that day. The feeling waxes and wains but never really leaves my mind. I have lived in the city, with my Sarah, the only person I trust, since. She's watched me grow bitter, god bless her soul, and I love her.

Back in 1980, I went through something I was unable to talk about for years of my life. I was paid a great, extortionate amount to keep my silence on the events.
It's not called Elmsworth anymore - you won't find it on a map or online. It's there for certain though, and I'm going to pay a visit one more time before I go. Maybe I can be a pretender.

**Commentary**
## Commentary

I I have produced two pieces of work that delve into the nuances of identity: a non-fiction article reflecting on the erosion of human-produced content due to AI, and a fiction short story exploring themes of nostalgia and shared identity, how a community can shape it.

My non-fiction piece draws on the insights and stylistic elements from Charlie Brooker's _I Can Make You Hate_, such as his ability to weave humour and incisive critique into discussions of modern societal issues. In contrast my fiction is inspired by Helen Oyeyemi's work _What's Not Yours is Not Yours_, specifically the _Sorry Doesn’t Sweeten her Tea short_ story, which examines personal identity through fantastical, unorthodox narratives and rich character development, however I was also greatly influenced by my personal enjoyment of reading short form horror stories. Both texts grapple with my shared theme of identity but do so through distinct lenses.

In _I Can Make You Hate_, my chosen stimulus text, Brooker employs a sardonic tone, synonymous with his works, to discuss how media and societal pressures shape our identities, particularly how we are conditioned to respond to authority and each other. My article closely mirrors his style by incorporating a similarly sardonic voice as I present my beliefs on the rise of artificial intelligence and how I feel towards the role it has rapidly taken in our modern era. In my work I describe the internet as being, “_subjected to a daily enshittification experimentation project_”, which highlights my frustrations with our modern day media, through a rather violent and brash lexis, echoing the critique style synonymous with Brooker and his works. His use of expletives and foul language extensively in both articles and books is famed – i.e. "_we're shitting out miraculous inventions_" to quote him in a famous 2016 article. Brooker uses harsh language as a vehicle to convey to such the extent that he is frustrated what he is critiquing (typically a societal norm, or technology), more effectively conveying his feelings in writing, although taking care to not overstate things: something I have aimed to do throughout my non fiction, evidenced by such phrases.

Moreover, the structure of my texts reflects their thematic concerns. My non-fiction article is organized into concise paragraphs, echoing the user-friendly style of Brooker’s, and direct engagement with the audience to enhance relatability. The rhythm of my writing mirrors Brooker’s punchy style, where short sentences punctuate longer reflections, creating an impactful reading experience. For instance, I make great use of directly addressing the reader in the second-person, for instance, “_Hell, ask any [AI] how many letter R's are in the word strawberry_” to evoke the sense of absurdity often found in Brooker's articles and writing, where he often uses both repetition and the use of the pronoun "you" -  how "You've got..." or "Now you've had..." to relate or suggest a frustrating experience with the reader, adding a layer of relatability to his writing.

However a way in which I've departed from Brooker's writing style is with how my article is structured.

Brooker's works often follow an atypical structure of ending on a bittersweet, sadistic tone, and this is is where my writing differs. Towards the end, my tone in my article shifts - I illustrate this when I discuss the difficulties the increased use of AI may bring about: “_hellish information regurgitation machine_”. In this quote, I employ vivid imagery, akin to Brooker’s use of hyperbole to critique the absurdities of modern living as he sees it.

 Both texts end off on a questionable, almost uncomfortable tone, deliberately chosen to force the reader to thoroughly consider the topic of the text after reading. This confrontational style invites readers to interrogate their own experiences and to challenge the reader - to get them to resist complacency with it. Brooker often concludes with an unconventional utterance such as “Now get out. \[last paragraph]” too, which I’ve mimicked closely in my writing with my fictitious ChatGPT conversation, to curve off my article.

Conversely, my fiction piece explores identity through the lens of memory, and the haunting effects of the past. It begins with a character returning to their hometown, Elmsworth, and grappling with their former life. The exploration of nostalgia is reminiscent of Oyeyemi’s work, where characters often navigate complex family and friend relationships alike, and the ghosts of their histories. Similarly, my protagonist's journey is marked by their discomfort and curiosity about the “_surprise_” that lingers in the air - a metaphor representative of the hidden truths within communities. This mimics Oyeyemi's writing closely, mirroring her tendency to weave intricate narratives that unveil the layers of identity shaped by family, culture, and societal expectations.

My fiction employs metaphorical language, and juxtaposing descriptions to explore the how the protagonist identifies with their hometown. When they describe Elmsworth as “_warmly nostalgic_” or "_wonderfully stagnant_" it both symbolises the weight of history, but also adds an oxymoronic-ish feel to the writing - like the word "stagnant" used, typically being associated with the old and unreliable, yet here it is for good, alluding the mixed feelings towards the past the protagonist holds.

This language was specifically chosen to mimic Oyeyemi's style of having phrases err on the side of positive and negative. In the phrase "_To the naked eye Boudicca is a haze of noxious green that lurks among fronds of seaweed... like the aftermath of a chemical spill. [page 90]"_ for example, has obvious negative connotations, yet also good, suggesting a deliberate, intricately picked colour. These deliberate contradictions in the writing also create a thick sense of mystery and suspense as the story is told through an unreliable narrator, who only knows as much as the reader does themselves, as the reader learns they cannot trust him/her.

I use a more introspective tone in my fiction, exploring the protagonist's internal struggle as they navigate the secrets of their hometown. The haunting imagery I employ - “_ghost-white mask of evil_” - reflects Oyeyemi's style of blending the supernatural with the tangible, for instance in the _Sorry Doesn't Sweeten Her Tea_ short story "_when you leave these doors unlocked, they swing halfway out... like somebody’s standing behind the door and holding it like that on purpose. [page 89]_" The protagonist’s eventual realisation that Elmsworth is more of an illusionary of what it was illustrates how identity is intricate, and is remarkably similar to Oyeyemi's writing, how speech and actions convince you of someone or something’s identity, how even minor changes are noticed by others.

The dialogue in my fiction piece serves a large use throughout the entirety of my fiction for uncovering the unspoken, and to drip feed breadcrumbs of information to the reader to drive the narrative, and how the protagonist discovers things. When the protagonist queries their old friends about the mysterious “_surprise_”, the atmosphere becomes an obvious tense moment, revealing a shared but unacknowledged fear among the characters. This use of dialogue closely mirrors Oyeyemi's ability to create subtextual layers through character interactions, where what is left unsaid often carries more weight than the spoken words.

Through both works written and analysed here, I present my belief that identity is not a fixed construct, but rather a fluid and evolving aspect of our lives - and above all something to take pride within. In my works I have thoroughly explored my shared theme in more ways than one, and in my writing I hope to provoke thought and discussion with my audience around the complexities of identity in contemporary society, much like Brooker and Oyeyemi have done through their respective works. Both pieces demonstrate how identity is a dynamic interplay of individual experiences and societal expectations, encouraging readers to reflect on their own journeys of self-discovery, and above all to be proud of their own characteristics, flaws, boons and who they are as human.
