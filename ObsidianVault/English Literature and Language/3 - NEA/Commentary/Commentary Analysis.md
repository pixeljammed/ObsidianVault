## Basic structure
1. I have produced two pieces...
	1. Non-fiction: the theme, what stimulus text, because of what. What it's intended for / target audience.
	2. My fictional monologue is inspired by who, because of their what. It focuses on what, and the audience it's written for.
2. The piece's voice effectively/convincingly creates a tone...
	1. Non fiction: language, conventions of genre, like vocabulary used. Quotes both the stimulus text and their own work, comparing them.
	2. Fiction: focuses on the character's tone and speech, for example her hyperbolic exclamations, how it shifts across the story.
3. Talks about the structure, 

## Notes
- Formulaic, not in a bad way, but is a good way to compare both pieces side by side with their stimulus texts.
- Throughout the whole commentary, there is constant returns at appropriate moments back to the stimulus text in every paragraph.
