The commentary is **an essay** exploring the influences and choices you made in your own writing, across both your *fiction* and *non fiction* pieces.

**Assignment 2: Commentary**
- Students will produce an analytical commentary to accompany their original writing. In their commentary, students will reflect on the writing process for both pieces.
- They should evaluate:
	- The findings of their initial research into the topic and texts
	- The influence of their studied texts and how they are reflected into the topic and texts
	- The influence of their studied texts and how they are reflected in their written pieces
	- The linguistic and literary feature used in the style models that they have adopted in their own writing
	- The language choices they made, through the drafting process, to achieve effects appropriate to the chosen function and target audience.
	- Students should ensure that any texts and other sources are accurately referenced.


> [!NOTE] Talk about..
> 1. Your **FINDINGS** in the text - what you discovered and selected, that interested you in terms of issue
> 2. The **INFLUENCE** of the studied text - how it inspired your piece.
> 3. How those things are reflected in your work
> 4. The **LINGUISTIC** and **LITERARY TECHNIQUES** you have **ADOPTED**.
> 	- *An interesting word. What does adopted mean?*
> 5. **GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE** - choices you made in your writing, like complex and fragment sentences for example, and what **EFFECT** they give.

## Reflection
- How confident do you feel, talking about your **stimulus texts**? What might you need to do?
	- I think, realistically, I should try re-read my stimulus texts over the weekend - I have forgotten them for the most parts and citing them is essential to my writing.
	- Charlie Brooker tries to kind of push against the reader's comfort - for instance unidealizing societal norms, like the extended use of technology he sees in modern times.
- What **STYLISTIC** - linguistic and literary features did you particularly focus on in your source texts and why?
	- I tried to use foreshadowing a lot in my writing, especially in my fiction writing, and left "crumbs" to hint at the ending.
- How have you made **LINKS** between those source texts and your own writing? Are these quite strong or could they be made clearer.
	- 
- How have you been **keeping notes** on your reading and preparation?
	- I have been using Obsidian to take notes on my thoughts while reading the stimulus texts.
