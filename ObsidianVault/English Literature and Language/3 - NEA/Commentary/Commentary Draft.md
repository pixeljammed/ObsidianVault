I have produced two pieces that delve into the nuances of identity: a non-fiction personal essay reflecting on my experiences dealing with a disorder, and a fiction short story exploring themes of nostalgia and uncovering dark secrets in a hometown.

My non-fiction piece draws on the insights and stylistic elements from Charlie Brooker's *I Can Make You Hate*, such as his ability to weave humour and incisive critique into discussions of modern societal issues. In contrast my fiction is inspired by Helen Oyeyemi's work *What's Not Yours is Not Yours*, which examines personal identity through fantastical, unorthodox narratives and rich character development, however I was also greatly influenced by my personal enjoyment of reading short form horror stories. Both texts grapple with my shared theme of identity, but do so through distinct lenses. 

In *I Can Make You Hate*, Brooker employs a sardonic tone, synonymous with his works, to discuss how media and societal pressures shape our identities, particularly how we are conditioned to respond to authority and each other. My personal essay closely mirrors his style by incorporating a similarly sardonic voice as I reflect on my experiences within both social, educational and personal situations being overwhelming sometimes. For example, the phrase, “XXXXX”, which highlights my frustration with an institution that diminishes personal identity, echoing the critique of societal norms synonymous with Brooker. He uses humour as a vehicle to convey a sense of disillusionment, allowing readers to recognise the absurdities of contemporary culture, and I have done similar within my own writing.

Conversely, my fiction piece explores identity through the lens of memory, and the haunting effects of the past. It begins with a character returning to their hometown, Elmsworth, and grappling with their former life. The exploration of nostalgia is reminiscent of Oyeyemi’s work, where characters often navigate complex family and friend relationships alike, and the ghosts of their histories. Similarly, my protagonist's journey is marked by their discomfort and curiosity about the “surprise” that lingers in the air - a metaphor representative of the hidden truths within communities. This mimics Oyeyemi's writing closely, mirroring her tendency to weave intricate narratives that unveil the layers of identity shaped by family, culture, and societal expectations.

Brooker's works often follow an atypical structure of ending on a bittersweet, cynical tone, and this is mirrored in my own writing. Towards the end, my tone in my essay shifts, much like Brooker's, to emphasise the absurdity of certain expectations. I illustrate this when I discuss the pressures students face: “XXXXX”. Here, I employ vivid imagery that invites readers to visualise the chaos of student life in sixth form, akin to Brooker’s use of hyperbole to critique the absurdities of modern living as he sees it. Finally, both texts end off on a questionable, almost uncomfortable tone, deliberately chosen to force the reader to thoroughly consider the topic of the text after reading. This confrontational style invites readers to interrogate their own experiences and challenges them to resist complacency. 

Again, my fiction piece uses a more introspective tone, exploring the protagonist's internal struggle as they navigate the secrets of their hometown. The haunting imagery I employ - “ghost-white mask of evil” - reflects Oyeyemi's style of blending the supernatural with the tangible. Here, identity becomes a collective experience, shaped not only by personal memories but also by the shared history of a community. The protagonist’s realisation that Elmsworth is not as it initially seems illustrates how identity is intricate, how speech and actions convince you of someone's identity.

In one moment, my protagonist reflects on the nostalgic comfort of Elmsworth, stating, “It was as if time had accelerated past Elmsworth, leaving it wonderfully stagnant.” This moment of realisation encapsulates the tension between the comfort of familiarity and the fear of confronting unresolved issues. Similarly, Oyeyemi’s characters often grapple with their identities as they confront the past - showing that understanding oneself is an ongoing process influenced by history and place.

The dialogue in my fiction piece serves as a vehicle for uncovering the unspoken tensions within the community. When the protagonist queries their old friends about the mysterious “surprise,” the atmosphere becomes thick with tension, revealing a shared but unacknowledged fear among the characters. This use of dialogue echoes Oyeyemi's ability to create subtextual layers through character interactions, where what is left unsaid often carries more weight than the spoken words. The characters’ avoidance of the topic reveals how communal identity can become a façade, concealing deeper wounds and fears.

In my essay, I draw from Brooker’s comedic approach to address the absurdities of identity within educational institutions, using direct address and rhetorical questions to engage the reader. Brooker utilises phrases like, “*Now get out.*” or "*...overwhelmed by the sheer amount of jabber in the world.*". The delivery of his writing suggests a layer of irony within it, which I have mimicked in my work - as evidenced by phrases like "XXXXX"

While Brooker’s work often utilises dry humour to dismantle the structures that dictate identity, my fiction takes a darker turn, revealing the consequences of unexamined trauma within communities. The frantic warning to the protagonist - *“Don’t ever ask about that in Elmsworth, okay? It’s safer if you forget”* - serves as a chilling reminder of the bad that can linger within a seemingly idyllic setting. This echoes Oyeyemi’s themes of memory and the weight of the past, as characters confront their histories while attempting to forge their identities in the present.

Moreover, the structure of my texts reflects their thematic concerns. My non-fiction essay is organised into concise paragraphs, echoing the user-friendly style of Brooker’s articles, while employing humour and direct engagement with the audience to enhance relatability. The rhythm of my writing mirrors Brooker’s punchy style, where short sentences punctuate longer reflections, creating an impactful reading experience. For instance, I use one-liners such as, “XXXXX” to evoke a sense of absurdity and draw readers in, much like Brooker’s biting quips.

In contrast, my fiction piece is structured around the protagonist’s introspective journey, using longer, flowing sentences to convey the emotional depth of their experiences. The narrative is interspersed with moments of suspense, leading to the climactic revelation of the “surprise” that has haunted the protagonist. This gradual unfolding mirrors Oyeyemi’s intricate narrative style, where the tension builds as characters confront their pasts. 

Additionally, both pieces incorporate elements of metaphor to deepen the exploration of identity. In my non fiction, I liken the education system to being a "XXXXX” conveying a visceral sense of disillusionment and critique. This metaphor underscores the detrimental effects of institutional pressures on individual identity. Brooker’s use of metaphor also reinforces his thematic concerns, as he depicts technology as being

On the other hand, my fiction employs metaphorical language to explore the protagonist’s relationship with their hometown. When they describe Elmsworth as “warmly nostalgic” and "wonderfully stagnant" it symbolises the weight of history. This metaphor resonates with Oyeyemi’s exploration of the past as a living entity that influences the present, emphasising the interconnectedness of identity and memory. Additionally, it suggests a mixed, juxtaposing tone - the word "stagnant" typically being associated with the old and unreliability, but used here it is for good, to suggest the mixed feelings towards the past the protagonist.

Ultimately, both my non-fiction essay and fiction piece reveal the multi faced nature of identity and the societal pressures that shape it. Through the lens of Brooker’s satirical critique and Oyeyemi’s fantastical narratives, I engage with themes of nostalgia, trauma, and the search for self in identity. My essay critiques the educational system as a constraining force, while my fiction explores the haunting shadows of the past within a community. Both pieces demonstrate how identity is a dynamic interplay of individual experiences and societal expectations, encouraging readers to reflect on their own journeys of self-discovery.

Through both works written and analysed here, I present my belief that identity is not a fixed construct, but rather a fluid and evolving aspect of our lives. Through my exploration of these themes, I hope to provoke thought and inspire conversations around the complexities of identity in contemporary society, much like Brooker and Oyeyemi have done through their respective works. By engaging with the absurdities and intricacies of identity, we can begin to unravel the threads that bind us and embrace the richness of our differing, yet human experience.
