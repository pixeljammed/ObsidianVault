[[Sea Wall - Simon Stephens]]

-----
## Summary
The monologue "Sea Wall" by Simon Stephens is a one-act play narrated by Alex, a 31-year-old father of two, reflecting on his relationship with his father-in-law Arthur and the tragic accident that occurred during a family holiday in France. Alex recounts his admiration for Arthur, a former soldier turned math teacher, and their annual trips to Arthur's house in Toulon. He describes moments of intimacy with his wife Helen and their daughter Lucy, as well as philosophical discussions with Arthur about the existence of God. However, the narrative takes a dark turn when Lucy falls off a cliff and suffers a fatal injury. The play ends with Alex's struggle to cope with grief and his belief that despite uncertainties, knowledge will eventually provide answers.

## Group Work: *Sea Wall*
1) I think it's about Alex struggles with his emotions and his uncertainties, maybe his inability to communicate
2) A philosophical

## Questions:

- **When the monologue begins, Stephens doesn't name 'she' or 'him'. Who are they? Why might Stephens hold back this information right at the start?**

- **What image do we get of Arthur, Alex's father-in-law? Why does Stephens create this image before he talks about Arthur's relationship with Lucy?**

- **Stephens has Alex self-interrupt, going off on tangents (side stories) throughout the monologue. Why do you think Stephens does this?**
	- **What does it mimic or reflect in real-life?**
	- **What might it reflect about how Alex is feeling?**

- **Why do you think Stephens emphasises the relationship between Alex and his father-in-law Arthur?**

- **Why do you think Stephens builds the play around the visit to the Sea Wall? What could it reflect about Alex's life?**

- **Throughout the monologue, Stephens changes tense quite a lot. What does this do? Why does**
- **the use of tense matter, given the story the monologue tells?**

- **Alex tells us that Lucy was born by Caesarean section and that he got very worried during the birth. What could this foreshadow for later in the play?**

- **Alex says "And it's been very rare the times in our relationship when she's cried and I've comforted her." What could this reveal about Alex's relationship with his wife, Helen?**
	- **Why does Alex tell us that now he’s crying all the time?**
	- **What might be the significance of Alex’s crying “at Ground Force when the person comes back”?**

- **Stephens also has Alex reflect on several conversations he's had with Arthur about God and faith.**
	- **Why do you think Alex keeps coming back to these conversations? Why does it matter that Arthur's opinions are different to Alex's?**
		- **How might Arthur's opinions about God seem different by the end of the monologue?**

- **"We're very happy. She's just. We just want her." This line is incredibly affectionate, but changes meaning entirely by the end of the monologue. How does this line add to the tragedy of the monologue?**

- **Alex tells an anecdote about a prior visit to France where he "cracked \[his] coccyx against a stone on the shore's edge," how does this anecdote foreshadow the rest of the monologue? Why does Stephens include it?**
	- **When you don't know the end of the monologue, how could this affect the audience?**

- **What could the tide be a metaphor for? What could be ‘catch’ing Alex? What do you think of the advice he gives: “Collect your breathing. Kick slowly. You’re moving.”**

- **Alex acknowledges the audience on the fourth page: “There’s a hole running through the centre of my stomach. You must have all felt a bit awkward because you can probably see it.” What does it do to the monologue to have Alex talk to us so directly?**
	- **What is the ‘hole’ in Alex’s stomach symbolising?**

- **How does Stephens foreshadow that something in Alex’s life is going to change, and probably for the worse?**

- **Stephens keeps having Alex mention “the cruellest thing I ever did to anybody”. Does he ever tell us what it was?**
	- **What are the other references?**
	- **What is it that Alex might have said? Who does he say it to?**
