## Summary
It's a memoir about how the author once borrowed *Charlotte's Webb* from her school when she was younger, and how it affected her younger self and maybe realising the power of literature - and how it can make you **feel**.

-----
## Points of Discussion
- What does the story represent in both the author's life and the story's author's life?
- What do you think Lucy Mangan does now?
- The last line - "A reader I know tells me so" - what does it mean?

## How does this text meet the conventions of a memoir?
Again, like [[Lavinia Greenlaw]], it's a personal account told from her perspective and is reflective of the past. It's almost entirely specific to her own personal experience with the book and also talks about the future too (last paragraph).
