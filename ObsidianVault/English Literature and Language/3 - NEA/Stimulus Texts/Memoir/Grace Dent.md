## Questions
What **attitudes** to work is Dent expressing here?
- She enjoys her job thoroughly, as it's rather extravagant as opposed to your typical desk job, for example her use of the word "glamorous" in relation to her newfound work life.
- She's good at what she does, and is well respected in her line of work, thanks to her rather unorthodox skills, ex: *getting a Chanel jacket off of a dry cleaners for free.*

What **methods** does Dent use?
- She makes use significantly of **non-verbal actions**, i.e:
	- Describing herself as *"...flopping onto the supersized bed..."*
	- *"Stared, mouth ajar..."* - facial expressionism
	- These could also be considered **hyperbole**.
- She also writes very linearly (arguably a convention of the memoir genre) as if she is in a movie, or narrating one, similar to the role Nick plays in [[The Great Gatsby]] in some regard.

Make two points of comparison between the attitudes to work we see in Dent's essay and [[When I lived in Peru]].
- Grace seems to share a similar attitude about her job to Claire's in [[When I lived in Peru]], as they both seems to enjoy their line of work and have recently gotten a **very nice** promotion or treat from their higher ups.
- They seem thrilled at these, and convey their excitement through their voice (quite literally, as one is a [[Overview - Radio drama|Radio Drama]]) and also through their mannerisms/actions.
