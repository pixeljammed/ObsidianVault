**POLICE INVESTIGATION: MISSING PERSONS - CASE OF MAN NAMED ONLY "DANIEL".

Wanted on suspicion of:
- ARMED ROBBERY
- GRAND THEFT AUTO
- LACK OF IDENTIFICATION / POSSIBLY NOT RESIDENT OF THE STATES

Suspect has been wanted for quite some time, has rarely been spotted on and off around the East coast from 1991 to 1995 before slipping off before authorities can catch him.

Attached below is the singular piece of evidence of/against him - whether it is reliable is up for debate.

Evidence extracted out of a journal - belonging to the owner of a diner called the "De Lake Eat In" along route 613 in Nevada. Police did not take the whole journal for evidence as per the owner's request to keep it. This piece shows the last week of her journal (07/08/1996).

Diner owner claims to ask people who come in for stories out of their lives out of boredom working here. When asked why she told us *"There's a mysterious allure about the individual man or woman who stops here, unaccompanied \[on a trip]"*. Take quote with pinch of salt - could possibly be a cover up?
