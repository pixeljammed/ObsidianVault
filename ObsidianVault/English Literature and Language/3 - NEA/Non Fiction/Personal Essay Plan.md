How this blends well with my topic:


| **Content Overview**            | My personal essay will focus on the topic of how the place you are born determines so much of your oppertunities in life. And how unfair that is, you should be grateful for your position or priviledge.                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Genre, audience and purpose** | The genre will be an essay, but it will take a tone + writing style similar to Caitlin Moran's article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Link to shared theme**        | My shared theme is Identity, and this ties in with your background, and how you originate from a long line of ancestors. For me, my parents were second/third generation immigrants and learning how both sides of my family ended up in the UK                                                                                                                         |
| **Structure**                   | The structure of the text will follow a typical one for an essay.<br><br>1) Introduction<br>2) Body text - around 3/4 paragraphs<br>3) Conclusion                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Influence of stimulus text**  | Kaitlin Moran writes about her experience as a refugee. In my opinion it provides a good insight into the scale of immigration and how ironic the hatred stemming towards them is. It says that people should be more empathetic towards refugees and that they are good people in bad situations, and rightfully so wish to escape or have a better life.<br><br>      |
