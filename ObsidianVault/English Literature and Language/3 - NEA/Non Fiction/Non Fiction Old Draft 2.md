Here's food for thought - the odds of being born in a **first world country** and **above the poverty line** is around [12.5%](https://reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/29sn87/request_what_are_the_odds_of_being_born_in_a/). To visualise that for you, imagine if when you were born, you were told to pick a randomly chosen slice of a pizza cut into 8ths.

If you choose correctly, you'll get to live a (hopefully) good and typical life like we think of. Obviously, because you are currently reading this, consider yourself lucky, because a significant factor in personal success relies on your birth circumstances.

There is no question here that this is an ultimate failure

For me, I was born in the United Kingdom and I am forever grateful for that fact. My family stem from far corners of the world, contrarily, and in a way, I do think there's a beauty in that regard. However, I can't help but empathise for my past ancestors in a strange manner.
I'm a third, no, forth generation migrant and I'm incredibly happy that I am where I am. I don't think everyone could say that. There are a lot of people who are incredibly worse off than me.



It's above my pay grade, to even try *partly* answer the question of "are we the creators of our own lives?", because it's a debacle not even some of the greatest minds of our generations can even proclaim to answer; certainly not me either!

But to brief, I *personally* view being born, and the circumstances in which you are thrust into upon your birthdate, as complete, utter and randomised chance.

If I am truthful with myself, I would't like to be born into a developing country, nor one in conflict, nor into poverty. I don't think anyone would, and those who do live these lives I wish them luck in living your dreams.

Pity helps nobody - granted, but I can imagine at least what my grandma might have gone through when the Japanese invaded her country, and she had to hide in a pigsty, and live off 2 cups of rice per day, split between a family of 4.
Or her daughter, my grandma who worked hard all her life to move to the United Kingdom and leave all of her family behind in Hong Kong, and her husband who committed suicide when my mum was 8.
And my mum who grew up facing racism throughout her time constantly moving through the UK, none of which I have had to face thanks to our progressive education system.

Where you are born is such a huge, unfair factor.
The dice roll of life is a cruel mistress - the odds are skewed towards the worser end, and there is no safety net for you to fall back onto.
Bill Gates once said *"if you're born poor it's not your fault, but if you die poor it's your fault."*

I think Bill Gates is a pillock (here, at least).

The quote sounds motivational, but poverty is never a choice due to many factors (privilege, education, health, opportunity, proper guidance). You don't choose your circumstances at birth. You might not even live past 5 in a lot of awful places.
The poor are most likely the most hardworking people around, just unlucky enough to be born 




This doesn’t mean that you can’t succeed if you are born into a small, poor family. It also doesn’t mean that if you were born into a wealthy family that your own success isn’t earned.
