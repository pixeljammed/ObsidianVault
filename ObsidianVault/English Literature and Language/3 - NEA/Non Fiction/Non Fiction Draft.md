## How To Build A Rocket While Forgetting Your Socks

Now when I was around 11 years old I was thrown into a clinic, thrown into a whirlwind of questions and thrown out with a diagnosis of Autism. At the time I didn't think it was correct - I thrived socially, did well in education, matter of fact I felt it was insulting to a degree. It was an inane observation in my eyes from an assessor far too astute for her boots, I thought, but looking back I think I've grown to fit the epithet.
To say I cared for the label of "autism" would be a lie, it really was nothing more a title for me and another calling for my immature lovely little brother to jeer at me for (I fear I've done worse back however!), but as I aged I did deject the word less and less, and felt more identifying with it. My social awareness seemed to mature more, and in turn social situations I once viewed as funny clarified themself as awkward. 

Later in life in the middle of my first year of sixth form, I was thrown once again into a rediagnosis of ADHD. This made infinitely more sense to me; things that were synonymous with ADHD, like me running around when I should be sat down working, felt more in line. It explained why I could never focus, especially at home, even when I knew I had to for say an upcoming test. One of my greatest frustrations was how I was seemingly never productive in any manner at home, how I envied classmates, peers who could seem to do the impossible - put themself to do so much work without finding themself knee-deep in an internet rabbithole hours later.

I think getting the diagnosis made everything apparent to me. Obviously these conditions don't materialise, or intensify as soon as a doctor tells you such, but it explained a lot. It explained how I cruised through much of primary and secondary without a second thought, for one, and it explained why I loved dancing, yelling, tapping on tables at home. I started medication in May of this year and the process of dosage, timing and making sure I eat enough beforehand has been a trouble in-of-itself.

I believe that it's important I try not to identify too much with the label of ADHD, out for fear I slip into aligning myself with the stereotyped values. The online "support community" is more of an echo-chamber than anything, if you ask me.

Arguably the worst part is the fleeting, false optimism that ADHD delivers at the oddest times. Days when you felt like you are on top and organised with everything slowly melt into an disarray of unorthodox study patterns, where productivity is few and far between. By the end of the day you're left debating weather to neglect the work, push it back to tomorrow, or drain your body of energy, stay up all night and finish what should have been done hours ago. ADHD doesn’t look the same every day. Sometimes, I can "hyperfocus" so intensely that I forget to eat. Other days, I couldn’t care. There’s no energy, no spark, just an overwhelming fog of indifference. That’s the insidious nature of the condition; you can’t plan for how your brain will behave on any given day, you never know which version of yourself will show up.

But really, I think I could build a rocket. I think I could build a rocket if you gave me the materials, time, and a good enough motive. I've done good things, for myself, of course. Taught myself cloud computing for a free Minecraft server. I'd dabble in machine learning on an impromptu Thursday afternoon. No doubt I can do great feats when I put my mind to it, not to be boastful in my actions, but I am capable of such.
Well-intentioned friends often see this and claim of my intelligence but really I am a slob when it comes to the other bits. ADHD is a double edged sword where interests are magnified - but so is the uninteresting. 

The same condition that turns simple tasks into Herculean efforts is a double edged sword that lets me excel at what I like, maybe not what I'm good at. To stay organised is a sisyphus-like effort that's so long-drawn, it's easier to save my tears remaining stagnant in my odd lifestyle dependant on deadlines to rear-kick me with force into doing work. I'm almost whipped into doing work, but if it isn't broken don't fix it!

Being thrown into sixth form as a student has been a learning experience for better or worse, as my few successes in my studies came marred with the looming creep of deadlines. Time appears to almost warp when your brain is pining, teasing you with distractions that have an irresistible suck to them. 
The easiest allegory for me is like trying to connect two same-ended magnets together; you push them together, and they do the opposite of what you expect, never meeting. I'll chalk it up to laziness - sometimes, but really this isn't your typical procrastination either; it’s more insidious. It extends to everyday situations that people with **normal** brain chemistry take for granted. ADHD can make the trivial monumental, and the monumental trivial. If that's an advantage or disadvantage is anyone's guess.
