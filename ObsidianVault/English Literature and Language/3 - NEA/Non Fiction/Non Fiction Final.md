## The Death of Creativity is Now

"Word vomit" is the best noun to describe the current way the current internet is heading towards being, if you'd ask me.

Yes really, the internet. The beautiful thing full of love, hate and online discourse forums where you can bleed your heart out over multimedia, and chock full of others doing the same, is being subjected of a daily enshittification experimentation project only growing exponentially by the day. The world wide web's steady fall into the artificially-generated rubbish-bin continues, and it saddens me. The great equaliser, as everyone hails it, is beginning to fail.

We are beginning to reach a point where real, organic arts like writing, art, music, video are about to class as a rare species. Go log in to social media. Just today, how many of those tweets you see do you think were *really* typed out key by key by an actual human, as opposed to bots? Click on Google images, search something - how many of the results are tagged as artificially created? Go on Spotify and it won't take you more than a minute to find songs that humans had no part in making, pushed to the front page by the corporation themself. 
Goodness, how many English essays being marked right now are composed by a "generative" AI?

Right now we're witnessing the modern-day-era equivalent of the tabloid. Short, sensationalistic, spam, and nothing more. *57.1% of All the Internet is AI Generated Slime, Researchers find*, rings a headline from just the beginning of this year. The paper is yet to be reviewed but really I have no doubt in this figure. Amazon, of all companies found that, in an effective ploy to immediately tarnish the vast landscape that is our web, we've already 
I'm not going to boldly proclaim it to be the modern-day burning of the library of Alexandra, no. But you'd be outright stupid to think of this hellish information regurgitation machine as even remotely good. 
You know, I'm no luddite - I love seeing new technology being put to great use. I've loved computers since I was a young'un but for crying out loud what actual purpose do nonsensical, hallucinated, words on a page do to benefit us?
Why are we so eager as a race to dry out characters, personas, identities in media through this. AI has no understanding of the wry, stupid humour riddled in irony found in writers. It has no one set of beliefs, no opinions synonymous with a certain radio or podcast host you might tune into and like. It can't come up with a new game idea nobody's ever thought of before. Right now, ChatGPT could not tell apart obvious sarcasm if you spelt it out to it. Hell ask any "large language learning model" (gosh - none of those words are in the bible!) how many letter Rs are in the word strawberry. You'll find mirthful humour in its lost confidence - honestly the only thing I'm jealous of it for.

While that the dopemine-fried generation that comes after us will be knowing to the pitfalls of AI. I can swear to the fact one of your elders have interacted, liked, commented on artificial content, taking it as real. If you have facebook you'll know what I'm banging on about. 


Honestly I am both worried and hopeful. There's obviously a massive pushback online right now against artificial intelligence. I love it. I wonder if this is what *Rage Against the Machine* were on about. 
I think people will begin to appreciate humanity in writing more from now on. I think people will appreciate reviews, editing and articles like this more. The value of real, human-written text is going to only get more valuable in a sea of endlessly regenerating, growing spam - both to humans and the engineers training said AI. You can tell when a human has written something. ChatGPT or any alike have no concept of reoccurring inside jokes, how to listen to your readers, or any long term retention of your audience. I think we will be alright, you know. After all, why would I bother to read something, that nobody even bothered to write? Why would you admire a painting nobody bothered to paint? Why listen to a song composed by no one? 
You tell me.
