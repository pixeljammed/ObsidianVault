> [!NOTE]- Hiroshima Account
> The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people and injured more than 70,000 others.
> 
> On August 6th there wasnâ€™t a cloud in the sky above Hiroshima, and a mild, hardly perceptible wind blew from the south. Visibility was almost perfect for ten or twelve miles.
> 
> At nine minutes past seven in the morning an air-raid warning sounded and four American B-29 planes appeared. To the north of the town, two of them turned and made off to the south, and disappeared in the direction of the Shoho Sea. The other two, after having circled the neighbourhood of Shukai, flew off at high speed southwards in the direction of the Bingo Sea.
> 
> At 7.31 the all-clear was given. Feeling themselves in safety people came out of their shelters and went about their affairs and the work of the day began. Suddenly a glaring whitish pinkish light appeared in the sky accompanied by an unnatural tremor which was followed almost immediately by a wave of suffocating heat and a wind which swept away everything in its path.
> 
> Within a few seconds the thousands of people in the streets and the gardens in the centre of the town were scorched by a wave of searing heat.
> 
> Many were killed instantly, others lay writhing on the ground screaming in agony from the intolerable pain of their burns. Everything standing upright in the way of the blast, walls, houses, factories and other buildings, was annihilated and the debris spun round in a whirlwind and was carried up into the air. Trams were picked up and tossed aside as though they had neither weight nor solidity. Trains were flung off the rails as though they were toys. Horses, dogs and cattle suffered the same fate as human beings. Every living thing was petrified in an attitude of indescribable suffering. Even the vegetation did not escape. Trees went up in the flames, the rice plants lost their greenness, the grass burned on the ground like dry straw.
> 
> Beyond the zone of utter death in which nothing remained alive houses collapsed in a whirl of beams, bricks and girders. Up to almost three miles from the centre of the explosion lightly built houses were flattened as though they had been built of cardboard. Those who were inside were either killed or wounded. Those who managed to extricate themselves by some miracle found themselves surrounded by a ring of fire. And the few who succeeded in making their way to safety generally died twenty or thirty days later from the delayed effects of the deadly gamma rays. Some of the reinforced concrete or stone buildings remained standing but their interiors were completely gutted by the blast.
> 
> About half an hour after the explosion whilst the sky all around Hiroshima was still cloudless a fine rain began to fall on the town and went on for about five minutes. It was caused by the sudden rise of over-heated air to a great height, where it condensed and fell back as rain. Then a violent wind rose and the fires extended with terrible rapidity, because most Japanese houses are built only of timber and straw. By the evening the fire began to die down and then it went out. There was nothing left to burn. Hiroshima had ceased to exist.

## Notes

**Genre**
The genre is non-fiction and reads like a reportage you would typically find in a newspaper.
The nature of this report being scientific and non fictional, exacerbates the extreme language chosen - making the 

**Audience**
The audience for this could be either Americans or English people who've been uninformed on the things that happened post-WW2.  This is assumed from the obvious English language who the allies side of WW2 spoke - the ones who dropped the bomb.

**Purpose**
A lot of Americans have split opinions on the atomic bomb [even to this day](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/31306-75-years-hiroshima-and-nagasaki-americans-still-di), so maybe this article was to sway public opinion for people who believed it was "necessary", by giving a vivid first hand account to garner sympathy for the people killed. Certain parts of the 

**Lexis**
Familiar words like "safety", "work" and "affairs" create the scene of a bright Hiroshima and a sense of innocence of the victims involved, as it highlights similarities between the typical American or English reader and those in Hiroshima.

Words such as "gamma rays," "air-raid warning," "B-29 planes," "whirlwind," and "reinforced concrete" transition the writing into a factual, scientific, almost clinical tone immediately thereafter. It grounds the writing in realism and creates an atmosphere of cold, engineered devastation.

Numbers and figures are used in conjunction with phrases like "writhing on the ground," "screaming in agony," to illustrate suffering en masse, and the "70,000 killed, 70,000 injured" only magnify the vividness, and appeal to Logos to highlight the massive amount of human suffering involved within the tragedy.

**Grammar / syntax**
The story is set up to juxtapose scenes of war against peace - "there wasn't a cloud in the sky", and the air raid sirens being dismissed as if it were a false alarm lay out a narrative of people being almost *manipulated* into their demise and horrible fate.

Simple sentences have a semantic field of finality - to suggest how Hiroshima will be forever affected by the tragedy.
