The theme of **love and music** is explored many times throughout both [[Phillip Larkin]] and [[Scott Fitzgerald]]'s work.

## 3 points of connection 
Both Phillip and Fitzgerald explore the complexity of relationships, + concept of "false love", in the sense that love is not always straightforward, often depicting stagnant and/or rocky couples, such as within [[Talking in Bed]] *for Phillip* and [[Tom and Daisy]] *for Fitzgerald.*

- [[Talking in Bed]] illustrates a couple with communications issues or alike, choosing to sweep issues within the unnamed relationship "under the rug".

- [[Tom and Daisy]]'s relationship within [[The Great Gatsby]] instead
	- *"They both are married to each other only for image concerns: Tom likes having a young, beautiful wife that makes him look good, and Daisy like the wealthy and comfortable lifestyle Tom provides."*
