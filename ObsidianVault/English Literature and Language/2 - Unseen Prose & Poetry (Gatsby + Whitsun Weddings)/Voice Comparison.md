In [[Mr Bleaney]] the voice is written in the first person, the voice belonging to an unnamed speaker, whom talks on the life of the previous tenant of a small apartment he is about to move in. The voice is a more somber and remorseful one - as the speaker notes the similarity of his life with Mr Bleaney's one.

In the Great Gatsby however, the narrative in Chapter 1 is provided by Nick Carraway, who serves as both a character in the story and its narrator. Nick's voice is observant, and somewhat detached in comparison to Mr Bleaney's voice, as he seems to not judge, but instead reflect upon those
Nick's attitude in Chapter 1 is one of curiosity and initial fascination with the world of Jay Gatsby and the opulence of East Egg.

Mr Bleaney is like a look into the writer's future for him. Now that he lies there at the same age and same place and he knows what the future held for whom was ahead of him, it leaves him to think and reflect on his life, and ultimately the irony and failure and exasperation of it. His voice turns more sour with each stanza and concludes in a melancholic way as he cannot help but compare his life to that of Mr Bleaney - setting him into reality - expressing a sense of loneliness and emptiness, of missed opportunities and a resigned acceptance of a dull existence.

Nick's attitude in Chapter 1 is one of curiosity and initial fascination with the world of Jay Gatsby and the opulence of East Egg. However, there is also an undertone of skepticism and a sense of reserve in his observations - ironic to how he opens with what his father taught him.
Mr Bleaney's depressing tone and language create an atmosphere of tiresomeness and incite feelings of bleakness to create a sense of voice - a voice of a person who is unwilling or hesitant to change their life for the better and of opportunities missed.

Both of these texts are very reflective of others lifes and their own, and convey a a disillusioned life of solitude (albeit to varying extents). They ponder on their past and future and have a lack of direction in some sort of way, uncertainty in themselves and identity while they try and fit themselves into a newfound life.
