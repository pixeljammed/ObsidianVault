- A **noun phrase** has a noun as its most important word. It might have one or more [[pre-modifiers]].
- A determiner specifies the number definiteness or context of a noun, e.g: **a, an, the, these, some, each**.
	- The determiners like **a, an, the** are definite article determiners.
	- While **these, some, each** are demonstrative determiners.
	- **My** is a possessive pronoun.
	
> [!WARNING] Important
> The [[pre-modifiers]] before a noun are **both** the determiner and one or more adjectivies. They work together.

*For example -* the phrase "a real hero":
The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">"a"</mark> is the determiner as it specifies there it's a single thing.
The word <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"real"</mark> is the adjective.
Both <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">"a"</mark> and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"real"</mark> are pre-modifiers here.

*Another example -* the phrase "My little girl":
The "my" is the determiner, and is also a possessive determiner
