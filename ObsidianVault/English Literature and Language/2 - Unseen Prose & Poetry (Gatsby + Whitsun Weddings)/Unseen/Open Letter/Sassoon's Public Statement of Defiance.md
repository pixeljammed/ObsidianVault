> [!NOTE]- Sassoon's protest, "A Soldier's Declaration," written on June 15, 1917:
> I am making this statement as an act of wilful defiance of military authority, because I believe that the War is being deliberately prolonged by those how have the power to end it. I am a soldier, convinced that I am acting on behalf of soldiers. I believe this War, upon which I entered as a war of defence and liberation, has now become a war of aggression and conquest. I believe that the purposes for which I and my fellow-soldiers entered upon this War should have been so clearly stated as to have made it impossible for them to be changed without our knowledge, and that, has this been done, the objects which actuated us would now be attainable by negotiation.
> 
> I have seen and endured the sufferings of the troops, and I can no longer be a party to prolonging those sufferings for ends which I believe to be eveil and unjust.
> 
> I am not protesting against the military conduct of the War, but against the political errors and insincerities for which the fighting men are being sacrificed.
> 
> On behalf of those who are suffering now, I make this protest against the deception which is being practiced on them. Also I believe that it may help to destroy the callous complacence with which the majority of those as home regard the continuance of agonies which they do not share, and which they have not sufficienct imagination to realise.

## Context
In World War 1, the infamous worldwide conflict that caused around 18 million deaths both combatants and civilians, occurred, in 1914 Europe after the assassination of Arch-Duke Franz Ferdinand.

By 1917, many soldiers were tired of the war, but one, in particular, went to great lengths to express how . A British soldier by the name of Lt. Siegfried Sassoon, and with the assistance of Bertrand Russell and John Middleton Murry, wrote a letter and circulated it among a number of influential people and the press. ] Initially it was written to Sassoon's commanding officer. 
It would be published in the Bradford Pioneer on July 27th, read to the House of Commons on July 30th, and be published again in the London Times. Needless to say, it caused quite the uproar.

## Questions
**What is an open letter?** 
- An open letter is a text directly aimed at sending a message at an individual or group, the difference being this is not send in private / confidence, and the general public are free to see it. ==Everyone is free to read an open letter.==
- The reason you might want to do this is because you could garner sympathy for your change or aim of the letter, from other people. In turn you would get more backing, and there would be more pressure + strength for the message.

**How does this open letter reflect generic conventions of an open letter?**
- It's language and structure is typical of a letter, for instance it opens with "I am making this statement...", and clearly stating its purpose straight off the bat.
- Specifically to an open letter it uses language suggesting a 

**In what ways are Sassoon's lexical choices powerful?**
- He uses a contrast of two vastly differing lexis, one almost patriotic, and one of malice.
	- For example, he refers to the war initially as one of "defence and liberation"—terms that invoke a sense of duty, sacrifice, and moral righteousness. But this is quickly juxtaposed with words like "aggression" and "conquest," which carry negative, violent connotations. This switch reflects not just Sassoon's thoughts as he argues, but rather the whole of the countries' forces.
	- His use of emotionally charged words such as “sufferings,” “evil,” and “unjust” lends the letter a sense of urgency and moral weight. These are not just neutral observations but loaded terms that reveal his strong conviction about the war’s misdirection. Words like “deception” and “callous complacence” further paint a picture of betrayal, as Sassoon accuses those in power of not only prolonging the war but doing so at the cost of human lives.
	- Sassoon’s repeated use of personal pronouns ex: “I believe” also has significant emotional power, humanising the writing and making it seem less corporational, yet professional. The anaphoric repetition also contributes to the use of logos.
		- The use of "I believe" is pretty important to the text. Without it, the personal connection would be removed, and the text sounds more abstract like grasping at straws. Because he's drawing on his own experiences it adds to the authenticity of the whole text. 

**In what ways are Sassoon's grammatical/ syntactical choices interesting?**
- Sassoon uses complex sentences to develop his arguments fully and give them weight. For example, in the line, _“I believe that the purposes for which I and my fellow-soldiers entered upon this War should have been so clearly stated...,”_ the multiple clauses emphasise the depth of Sassoon’s reflection on the war’s transformation. 
	- These extended sentences reflect the complexity of the situation, while also giving Sassoon the space to methodically lay out his arguments.
- Sassoon also has a sort of irony in his letter, saying how he is not "protesting the military conduct of the war" but rather the conditions him and his fellow troops are treated. It's an ironic moral stance, but does make sense, and his lexis, like "insincerities" to "deception" make the letter sound more of a formal, clear protest, as opposed to the hot-headedness typically expected of a militant.
