> ASTRONAUTS do not like to be called heroes. They point out that it takes hundreds of thousands of backroom engineers, mathematicians and technicians to make space flight possible. They are right, too: at the height of its pomp, in 1966, NASA was spending 4.4% of the American government’s budget, providing jobs for 400,000 people. It was those workers Neil Armstrong was thinking of when, as commander of Apollo 11, the mission that landed men on the moon on July 20th 1969, he emerged from the lunar module to talk of small steps for man and giant leaps for mankind.

> The achievement of his crew, relayed live on television, held the world spellbound. On their return to Earth the astronauts were mobbed, with presidents, prime ministers and kings jostling to be seen with them. As the first man to walk on another world, Mr Armstrong received the lion’s share of the adulation. He knew he did not deserve it. He had never been chosen to be first, he would explain in his gently slow-spoken, Midwestern way; he had simply been chosen to command that particular flight. Besides, the popular image of the hard-charging astronaut braving mortal danger, as other men might brave a trip to the dentist, was exaggerated. “For heaven’s sake, I loathe danger,” he told one interviewer before his fateful flight. Done properly, he said, space flight ought to be no more perilous than mixing a milkshake.

> Indeed, the popular image of the “right stuff” possessed by the astronaut corps-the bravery, the competitiveness, the swaggering machismo – was never the full story. The symbol of the test-pilot school at Edwards Air Force Base in Mojave Desert, where Armstrong spent years testing military jets, is a slide rule over a stylised fighter jet. In an address to America’s National Press Club in 2000, Armstrong offered the following s elf-portrait: “I am, and ever will be, a white-socks, pocket-protector. Nerdy engineer, born under the second law of thermodynamics, steeped in steam tables, in love with free-body diagrams, transformed by Laplace and propelled by compressible flow.” 
> 
> He had an engineer’s reserve, mixed with natural shyness. Even among the other astronauts, not renowned for their excitability, Armstrong was known as the “Ice Commander.” Mike Collins, one of Armstrong’s crew-mates on the historic moon mission, like his commander but mused that “Neil never transmits anything but a surface layer, and that only sparingly.” In one famous incident, Armstrong lost control of an unwieldy contraption nicknamed the “Flying Bedstead” that was designed to help astronauts train for the lunar landing. Ejecting only seconds before his craft hit the ground and exploded, Armstrong dusted himself off and coolly went back to his office for the rest of the day, presumably to finish up some paperwork. 
> 
> That unflappability served him well during the lunar landing. The original landing area turned out to be full of large boulders, and so Armstrong had to take control from his spacecraft’s primitive computer and skim across the lunar surface by hand, looking for somewhere suitable to set down. By the time he found his spot, there was only 25 seconds of fuel left in the tanks. 
> 
> It served him well back on Earth, too. The astronauts knew from the experiences of their predecessors on the Mercury and Gemini flights that their trip would transform them into celebrities. But theirs was the biggest achievement yet, and none were prepared for the adulation that awaited them. Puzzlingly for the pragmatic spaceman, their trip to the moon seemed to have elevated them to the status of oracles, and people pressed them on££ their thoughts from everything from religion to the future of the human species and the chance of world peace. 
> 
> Unlike some of his fellow astronauts (two of whom became senators), Armstrong chose a comparatively quiet retirement, teaching engineering at the University of Cincinnati. He returned to NASA twice, both times to serve on boards of enquiry, the first into the bear disaster of Apollo 13, and the second into the disintegration of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. He spent his final years on his farm in rural Ohio, flying gliders in his spare time (it was, said the supposedly emotionless engineer, the closet humans could come to being birds).

## Notes
**In what way does the text relate to the theme of society and the individual**
The text relates to society through speaking out how much society might look up upon an individual like Neil Armstrong, however offers an alternate perspective on how he himself didn't think much of himself, being described as "quiet and reserved"

The achievement of his crew, relayed live on television, held the world spellbound. On their return to Earth the astronauts were mobbed, with presidents, prime ministers and kings jostling to be seen with them. As the first man to walk on another world, Mr Armstrong received the lion’s share of the adulation. He knew he did not deserve it. He had never been chosen to be first, he would explain in his gently slow-spoken, Midwestern way; he had simply been chosen to command that particular flight. Besides, the popular image of the hard-charging astronaut braving mortal danger, as other men might brave a trip to the dentist, was exaggerated. “For heaven’s sake, I loathe danger,” he told one interviewer before his fateful flight. Done properly, he said, space flight ought to be no more perilous than mixing a milkshake.​

**Purpose**
This extract begins by conveying the scale and achievement from Neil Armstrong, and how much he was commended for something deemed amazing from society, and yet how he himself viewed it much differently, showing contrasting viewpoints on it.
I think this is meant to humanise Neil and keep a respectful tone in the obituary, without being excessive. 

**Language**
The lexis used in this extract are reminiscent of fantasy - words like "spellbound", "another world" and "lion's share" to elicit the surreality of the achievement, almost supernatural-like.
The mention of "presidents, prime ministers and kings" add
