The text is about a boy's experience in foster care as a young child. He has perspectives from both himself and from his assumed caretaker's diary and explains how he believes the system is geared towards efficiency rather than actually looking after children.

**Induividual and society**
I think there is a split between individual and society expressed here - with lots of rejection from society and a sense of falling through the gaps.
Between the two texts it clearly expresses how he's almost patronised by the system - expressed explicitly through the caretakers. The way the caretakers write in comparison is clinical and without emotion or identity.

There is a disconnect between the children as seen through the eyes of social care workers, and children how they see both themself and others as individuals with identity.

## Context
Lemn Sissay was believed to be called Norman Greenwood and then at the age of 17 was given a birth certificate, and found out his mother had been trying to get him back since he was little. I think you could argue at the time people of colour, or immigrants were looked down upon / marginalised.
