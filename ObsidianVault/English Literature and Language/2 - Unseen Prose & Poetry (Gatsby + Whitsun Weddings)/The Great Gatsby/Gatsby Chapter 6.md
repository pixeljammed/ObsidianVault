## Timeline of Gatsby's real life
In Chapter 6 we learn that:
- James Gatz came from a poorer family who worked a farm in North Dakota.
- He went to a college for two weeks, but found the job to support himself
- He was a fisherman and did odd jobs while living on lake superior, barley scraping by
	- He was waiting for an opportunity to pass him by.
- He saw from afar a yacht, and strikes up a plan
	- He falsified himself and americanised his assumably immigrant name into Jay Gatsby at that point
		- You could argue this is because of the discrimination against immigrants and his obviously subtly foreign name would have been lacking in that sense.
	-  He then uses a boat to go up to Dan Cody and his yacht and warn him that the wind will get him if he's to stay here for an hour or two more.

- When Cody's said to have been "a product... ...of every rush for metal since seventy-five" it is in reference to how he's gained his fortune through just that. Nevada is a state well known for its metal mining, specifically both silver, as well as during the American [gold rush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gold_mining_in_nevada).
- Conversely, Gatsby has scraped his way along in the West Egg and got by just about, being raised doing farmwork, a stark contrast with Cody's assumed fortune obtained through the metals.

- IDK lol
- For the second one it is probably a metaphor for Jay Gatsby and his deceitful falsified life he has made of himself, a yacht being comparable to his extravagant life and the wind representative of his lies catching up to him and it all crumbling down.

- It means how the life of Jay Gatsby, was fabricated from how he wished himself to be - his best self, who he then set himself out to become; shaping himself, sculpting, and shifting into that mould he has created for himself to fill .
- This is comparable to the [[American Dream]], as it's that belief and ideal that all Americans, at least in the 1920s strived to become (in essense - to be rich)
- To be fair it is rather honourable, how far Gatsby has come. Even considering his way of getting to this point, it is somewhat admirable how well he fit these shoes he made.

- Dan Cody taught James Gatz to be a criminal (specifically bootlegging), and in doing so sealed the "death" of James Gatz and the birth of Jay Gatsby.

- His truth in spite of his falsified identity is something he cannot hide the reality - the fabrication suggested to be almost an internal conflict with himself. 
- It took a toll on his mind as he knew he was living a lie, a metamorphic scheme.

- "I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a gray, florid man with a hard, empty face"
- This quote suggest that Gatsby as a man is awfully dull as a man, both in personal appearance and in feel - further reinforced by the prevailing fact he would drink alone.
-  Dan Cody taught James Gatz to be a criminal (specifically bootlegging), and in doing so sealed the "death" of James Gatz and the birth of Jay Gatsby.
- Gatbsy is enamoured by money, and this, along with his new found character of Jay Gatsby, is assumably why Daisy fell out of love with Gatsby.
