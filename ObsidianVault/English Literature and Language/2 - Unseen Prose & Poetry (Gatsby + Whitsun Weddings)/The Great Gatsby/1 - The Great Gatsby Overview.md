Gatsby really is a satire of 1920's America and the Jazz age. Fitzgerald was not afraid to exaggerate and glamourise it, nor shame it.

But is also a cautionary tale of tragedy - of missed communication, and missed opportunities that ultimately result in the deaths of 3 people.

It's small by that account - but it stays in the memory of Nick and us, the readers, forever.

>[!NOTE]+ Contextual Notes
>Fitzgerald literally described his relationship with his wife, Zelda, as "sexual recklessness." He was known in his circle as an alcoholic already.
> 
>Fast forward to their wedding day. Both F. Scott and Zelda were known throughout New York City for getting drunk and getting kicked out of hotels during their marriage. A couple causing chaos everywhere basically. Now, later in their marriage, Zelda began to have an affair with a French pilot. Much to her dismay, F. Scott found out about this affair and Zelda asked for a divorce. F. Scott basically denied her request for a divorce and locked her in a room. Like kidnapping style.
>
> Fast forward and F. Scott continues drinking excessively and begins to have an affair with a prostitute. Zelda somehow finds out about this affair and in a weird attempt to enact revenge on F. Scott, she literally throws herself down a set of stairs almost killing herself.
>
>  These two were definitely fire and gasoline. Even before meeting Scott, Zelda was known to have what we now refer to as mental health problems. There has been a lot of speculation into her family’s wealth only exacerbating these due to enablement. She was beautiful, terrifyingly smart, and confident.
>
> General accounts of Scott show him to have held a lifelong chip in his shoulder to the old-money American elites. He was considered nouveau riche, and was regularly rejected by old-money, including Zelda’s family during his initial attempts at courting her.
>
> Toss these two into a pit of money, fame, and a lot of true passion? There’s a reason Fitzgerald’s best works (and, lately, Zelda’s own writing) are heralded as perfect looks into how the American dream can twist and warp a person. They lived it together.

## Chapter 1
By starting with this sentence, Nick starts himself by presenting in himself  
East Egg
West Egg
Midwest

Chapter starts with: "In my younger and more vulnerable "

Chapter ends with: "*Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.*"

- What's implied here is privilege, and more deeply, almost the white supremacy and racism that was apparent in the 1920s - rooting back to America's start, with the colonization.
- These themes go well with the book's whole nature - the entire work is based around this flamboyant and extravagant lifestyle that people even the modern day aspire to have.
- The readers, are expected to admire the rich folk within this play, as at a surface level, when we are only just introduced to them, them seem admirable. They are presented as rich and just as sophisticated - and maybe that is who we aspire to be.
- Their richness but also ironic obliviousness through the book further adds to the satirical nature. E 

"It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road. 'How do you get to West Egg village?'

I told him, and as I walked on I was no longer lonely"

-----

## Chapter 2
In chapter 2 we are presented with the midlands, or "valley of ashes."


- Does anybody in Gatsby actually **achieve** their aims, without some form of corruption? 
- Jordan cheated on her championship
- Meyer Wolfshiem bought the world championship in 1917.
- This absolutely highlights the nature of the book. Even as early as chapter 2, the undertones are present.
- We meet Mrytle Wilson, a lower class social climber who goes behind her husband's back to have an affair with Tom.
	- "**I married [George] because I thought he was a gentleman... but he wasn't fit to lick my shoe.**"
	- In chapter 7 when George finds out Myrtle has been indeed cheating, he locks her away physically, unable to bear the thought of losing her.
		- This is ironically a direct parallel to Gatsby's life, who entrapped his wife within their marriage too, and later also sent her to be stuck in an insane asylum, where she later died.

-----
## Chapter 3
#### Summary
- Chapter 3 is Gatsby in full swing - where the part it is most known for (its glamourised portrayal of 1920's America and extravagant, capitalistic success) 
- Nick's invited to Gatsby's party through an invite - which he later learns is rare - nobody else seems to have been invited, simply turning up on their own accord.
- Gatsby then ends up meeting him, not aware that the person he happens to chat to, is Gatsby himself.
- Chapter 3 is where Nick Carraway's mask slips slightly, and thanks to the quote where he proclaims to be the most "honest man he knows" in an arrogant manner, he contradicts what he says right at the start of chapter 1.
- *Things are not well in paradise.*
#### Quotes
- "**There was music from my neighbour' house through the summer nights.**"
- "**In the blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.**"
- "**On week-ends, his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus.**"
- "**As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host**, but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the way of the cocktail table."
  "**At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.**
  **'Your face is familliar', he said, politely. 'Weren't you in the First Divison during the war?'**
  **'Why, yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.'**
  **'I was in the Sixteenth until June 1918. I knew l'd seen you somewhere before.'**
  **We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.**"
  
- "**Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues; and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people I have ever known.**"
	- This is a massive ironic kick, and is a massive contrast to 
  #### Notes
- The Great Gatsby was not successful at the time of its publication - presumably for its *undertones* being critical of the Jazz age.
- However, Fitzgerald, writing prudently, managed to accurately illustrate a satirical yet (ironically) faithful portrait of the 1920's.
- At a simple level, the reader might see it as a funny novel about the 1920's. But the

## Chapter 4
#### Summary
- Chapter 4 is where we learn Daisy and Tom's backstory.
- They go to New York and meet Mayor Wolfshiem - a capitalistic character
	- He is unapologetically a 
#### Notes
#### Quotes
- "**'He wants to know' continued Jordan, 'if you'll invite Daisy over to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.**"
	- This is said after the story of Gatsby and Daisy are revealed to him - and Nick realises he is effectively being used as a intermediately in Gatsby's quest to 'retrive daisy'.
- "**The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited 5 years, and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths - so that he could 'come over' some afternoon to a stranger's garden.**"
	- Note the phrase "dispensed starlight to casual moths"; as if his partygoers are simply arrogant and hungry for something.
	- The whole phrase itself is about how Gatsby effectively buys a big mansion on the opposite side of Daisy and Tom's and tries to allure her into him with these loud, extravagant parties.

-----
## Chapter 5
#### Summary
- In chapter 5, Gatsby and Daisy and Nick all collide - as they all go round to Nick's.
- It is arguably the most pivotal chapter in the novel, as Gatsby's entire pursuit of her seems to come to a head here.
#### Notes
- When Gatsby finally reunites with Daisy, he says "we've met before", similar to how he introduced himself to Nick
	- By saying this, Gatsby is bringing the past into the present, and the present into the past - in line with his character, effectively operating on the pursuit of the past.

- Nick is an untrustworthy narrator as we sort of see in this chapter
	- The story is not told chronologically, but rather **in the order of his memories**.
	-  He is also untrustworthy as he is selective as to what he tells us, the reader.
	- He is effectively **purposely misleading** us. 
	  This might be deliberately done by Fitzgerald for plot convenience, or it could be to paint him as a hypocrite, and stereotypical example of a capitalist in pursuit of the american dream.
	  This explains all of his contradictions
#### Quotes
- "**Daisy went upstairs to wash her face - too late I thought with humilation of my towels...**"
	- Nick worrying about his towels is telling of his overt self awareness here.
	- Even as a passing thought, his consideration of such an insignificant detail highlights his pettiness.
- **'My house looks well, doesn't it?' he demanded. 'See how the whole front of it catches the light'.**
	- Note the interesting choice of verb here - demanded.
	- He then says it took him 3 years to get the money for it - 
- "**'I thought you inherited your money?'. 'I did old sport.' he said, automatically.**"
	- Again note the choice of verb - automatically, as if he slipped up and corrected himself, foreshadowing the future!
-----
## Chapter 6
- In chapter 6 we meet the possible **other Gatsby**.
- Here we are revealed to the identity of James Gatz, and the idea of his obscure, unclear rise to new rich.
#### Notes
- It feels like Gatsby's delicately built house of cards, his life of lies is on the verge of collapsing in the coming chapters.
#### Quotes
- "He told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedants, which weren't even faintly true.
  Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him."
	- We are effectively being warned here by Nick.
	- This kind of foreshadows the future, but also kind of shows that Nick is finally become aware to the pattern that a lot of things told to him are not true.
	- By this point the reader assumably also knows they would be suspending their disbelief to think that Gatsby's lies are true.
		- In this way, Nick is kind of used as a parallel to the reader, and nudges them into the right narrative - confirming or disregarding their beliefs about Gatsby accordingly. 
	- This is a reason why Gatsby is so successful - it lures people in with the exaggerated golden Jazz age and the extravaganza of it all, and then pulls the rug on you to make the twists/tragedies all the more painful and powerful.
		- If you compare this writing style to someone like [[Phillip Larkin]], you almost expect a cynical tone from him - you automatically, assume a depressing and sad tone.
		- This is arguably why Gatsby is more well known and celebrated, as the slow reveal of the foreshadowed undertones come to the forefront by the end of the novel, making it enjoyable but also layered.
	- You even question previous things thanks to this quote - wondering if Gatsby even really knew Nick in the first place.
- "**...after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house - just as if it were five years ago.**"
	- Again Gatsby is living in pursuit of the past.
- "**'Can't repeat the past?' he cried incredulously. 'Why of course you can!'**"
	- Gatsby rebuttals this to Nick when he says "you can't repeat the past".
	- This is the most explicitly said quote you can have as evidence for the fact that Gatsby's entire life, persona and all is for a futile pursuit of the past.
	- Nick does not understand this as he has the opposite aim - to command the respect that Gatsby has, still admiring his now glaringly fake persona. Nick aspires for the future and wealth like a capitalist.
	- Gatsby doesn't want to believe it. He is genuinely deluded to think that he can re-live the past, to re-write history.
- "**Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something - and elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though there were more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.**"
	- Nick has run out of things to say, and highlights the idea of the poor communication throughout the novel. For instance,

## Chapter 7
#### Summary
- This chapter is where Mrytle is run over and killed by Gatsby it is assumed.
- However Daisy in actuality runs her over. 
- Gatsby has admirably taken the blame for her - which is eventually takes him to his grave.
- Weather Daisy purposely killed Myrtle is left ambitious on purpose by Fitzgerald.
#### Notes
- This chapter shows us the harsh reality of the American Dream - it's in reach, if you are born rich enough and white enough.
- Gatsby's world of lies falls apart in this chapter.
- You could argue that Nick's aspirations kind of shatter here. His idolisation of Gatsby has been turned upon him as he learns he has, in essense, been fooled.
	- Gatsby, like the statue of Ozymandias, falls apart in the desert (not literally).
	- You could argue this is literally the epitome, and flaw of The [[American Dream]] - to become rich, and die having made no meaningful impact on the world. Hedonism in effect - an eventful + happy, yet ultimately insignificant life.
#### Quotes
- **"It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night - and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over."**
	- Trimalchio was a freed slave in ancient rome.
	- Like Gatsby, he became rich through wine / alcohol.
	- Fitzgerald is drawing parallels between the characters, 
- **"He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the virgil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight - watching over nothing."**
	-

## Chapter 8
## Summary
## Notes
- Chapter 8 marks the 3rd major death of the book.
	- **Mrytle**
	- **Gatsby**
	- **Wilson**
- All the deaths that happen in the book happen off stage in a greek tragedy type manner (off-stage)
- But it is an effective way to present their death's through Nick's memory. Nick as the narrator is the perfect voice to present these deaths.
- 
## Quotes


- **"I couldn't sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage, frightening dreams."**
	-  You could say the whole novel is a "savage frightening dream".
- **Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby's drive, and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress - I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning would be too late.**
	- idk tbh?
- **"The chauffeur - he was one of Wolfshiem's proteges - hear the shots - afterward he could only say that he hadn't thought anything much about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house and my rushing anxiously up to the first thing that alarmed any one."**
- **"But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler gardener and I, hurried down to the pool.**
- **"With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden.**
- **"The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.**
	- Gatsby is bleeding into the pool, and there's a nice **juxtaposition** here. 
		- The delicate scene of the "*circle of red*" versus the final phrase - "t*he holocaust was complete*" is massively contrasting.
- **"It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson's body \[a little way off] in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.**
	- The final phrase here means that the cycle of deaths, the 3 deaths that I listed earlier, is put to an end.
	- Or, it could be like that all the wrong and innocent lives were taken.
	- Myrtle, Gatsby and Wilson all die as a result of this triadic 'revenge' arc, but the true people to blame leave unscathed.
	- Daisy, Tom and Nick all commit adultery to some extent in Gatsby. I think Nick describes it as the holocaust as he believes the wrong people died - a spree of death to those who didn't deserve it.

-----
## Chapter 9
#### Summary
- Chapter 9 takes place 2 years after the events of the previous one.
- Nick Carraway returns to the scene of the crime, and talks about it in a reflective, much wiser and almost surgical way.
#### Notes
- Daisy and Tom have **fled** - nowhere to be found.
	- This is telling of them wishing to only preserve their status / self image.
	- It really does become apparent, their arrogance and wrongdoing here. 
		- They effectively cause *(on purpose or not, it is deliberately left ambiguous weather Daisy deliberately killed Mrytle)* a massive tragedy - holocaust as Nick describes it - and avoid any and all responsibility.
- 
#### Quotes
- **"I couldn't forgive him or like him, but I saw what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused.**
- **They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.**
	- This is almost telling of Fitzgerald's own personal life. Him and his wife were like fire and gasoline, and were careless themselves too.
		- They both had affairs separately, but Fitzgerald denied her a divorce (like: *"...whatever it was that kept them together..."*)
		- You could argue he is massively projecting, or critiquing, his own relationship / self.
	- The society that these Jazz age people have made, throws lives away
		- Gatsby, Myrtle, Wilson
		- It is here where the line between obvious satire and serious critique from Fitzgerald of the "golden" of the Jazz age, gets **blurred**.
		- The 3 quick deaths in succession might seem too quick and unfelt by the reader, but in Chapter 9, Nick presents it more seriously, kind of making lives illustrated as **invaluable** in this society.
	
- **"Gatsby's house was still empty when I left - the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside."**
	- Even after his passing, Gatsby is still the subject of rumours and myths.
- **I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive."
	- 
- **"One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn't investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over."**
	- He leaves it very vague
- **"On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more."**
	- This second paragraph is very often skipped, as readers rush
	- To a certain extent, that "huge incoherent failure" is representative of Gatsby - as his house reflects him and his taste too. 
- **"On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone.**
	- Note his use of "raspingly",
