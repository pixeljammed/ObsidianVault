Nick is an untrustworthy narrator as we begin to see from chapter 2 and onwards. The evidence to support this would be:
- The story is not told chronologically, but rather **in the order of his memories**.
-  He is also untrustworthy as he is selective as to what he tells us, the reader.
- He is effectively **purposely misleading** us. 
	- This might be deliberately done by Fitzgerald for plot convenience, or it could be to paint him as a hypocrite, and stereotypical example of a capitalist in pursuit of the american dream.

This explains all of his contradictions *throughout* the book. 

-----

 When you look at Nick, he lies to the reader almost from start to finish. 

- He tells the reader he doesn't really drink and has only been drunk one time in his life.
	- He gets drunk continuously throughout the book. 
	
- He also claims to have ended his relationship out west (Daisy comments that he'd been engaged, but he dismisses it) and then starts to loosely date Jordan.
	- Around halfway through, you find out he'd actually been keeping up communication with his fiance out west and had been telling her he was in love with her. 
	
- He claims to **hate** Gatsby in the beginning ("Gatsby, who represents everything for which I have an unaffected scorn")
	- But, obviously, he **idolises** Gatsby. 
	- When Gatsby dies for instance, he seems like he's lost hope, feeling nihilistic towards his aspirations to be "like Gatsby".
	

**Basically- Nick lies about almost everything from the beginning to end.**
