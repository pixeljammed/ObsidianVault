## Example paragraph

> [!EXAMPLE]- Example paragraph
> <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Both writers present a celebration of traditional values associated with pre-World War 1 culture and present the ways these clash with the materialism and cynicism emerging later in the 20th century.</mark>  Through the lens of Nick’s narrative voice, Fitzgerald effectively constructs Gatsby as an embodiment of pure hope and aspiration, as Lewis sees him, embodying ‘an older, more humane America’. Nick’s awe and affection for Gatsby, captured in his recognition of Gatsby’s ‘extraordinary gift for hope’, contrasts with his damning tone as he refers to his contemporary 1922 society, which ‘preys on’ and destroys Gatsby.  Nick draws on images of decay and degeneration to condemn its moral corruption: it is a ‘rotten crowd’ infusing America with a ‘foul dust’.  The adjectives ‘foul’ and ‘rotten’ powerfully capture Nick’s disgust at his contemporary society. Just as Gatsby’s innocence clashes with the solely financially driven and cynical America, described by Lewis, Larkin’s affection for pre-1914 England clashes with the values of 1950s post-industrial society.  Larkin mourns the erosion of England’s pre-world war 1 innocence in ‘MCMXIV’: ‘Never such innocence again’. The framing of this elliptical clause, the terminal line of the poem, with the adverbs ‘never’ and ‘again’ highlights the finality of the loss of the wholesome lifestyle and values of pre-1914 society. Larkin’s appreciation of this pre-World War I innocence clashes with the values of his contemporary 1950s urban society, ‘the cut-price crowd, urban yet simple’, obsessed with shopping rather than ‘tidy gardens’ or ‘playing out’.  Larkin accentuates his disgust and snobbish contempt for his contemporary society here through pre-modification and post-modification, the pre-modifying compound adjective ‘cut-price’ particularly contemptuous and the post-modifying adjective ‘simple’, explicitly disparaging about England’s unsophisticated, intellectually limited working class.  Modern society’s concerns clash with Larkin’s celebration of the innocence of pre-World War 1 England in which even ‘marriages last a little longer’, the comparative adjective here underscoring Larkin’s intention to compare.  Larkin’s depiction of 1950s consumerist Hull reflects the expansion of cities and the massive building programme as explored in Galbraith’s ‘The Affluent Society’. While Fitzgerald is primarily interested in the American Dream and clashing conceptions of what it is to be an aspirational American, Larkin most effectively explores the clash between his English conservative values, as a poet from The Movement, and how these clash with emerging priorities in post-industrial England.
