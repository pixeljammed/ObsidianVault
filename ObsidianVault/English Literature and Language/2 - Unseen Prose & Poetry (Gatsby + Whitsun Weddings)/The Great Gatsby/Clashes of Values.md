here are a few clashes of values in _The Great Gatsby_:

- **Clash of Gender / Attitudes Towards Women**  
    The novel reflects conflicting attitudes toward women in the 1920s. On one hand, the era saw the emergence of the "New Woman" symbolized by characters like Jordan Baker, who defy traditional roles. On the other hand, traditional views on gender roles remain evident, particularly in Tom Buchanan's controlling behavior towards Daisy and his mistress, Myrtle.
    
- **New Money and Its Values and Attitudes**  
    Characters like Jay Gatsby represent "new money" and its pursuit of the American Dream. Gatsby’s flamboyant parties and ostentatious lifestyle reflect this ambition. However, these values clash with those of the "old money" characters, such as Tom and Daisy Buchanan, who disdain Gatsby's lack of social pedigree.
    
- **Upper Class vs Working Class Values**  
    The novel highlights the struggles between the upper and working classes. Myrtle Wilson aspires to climb the social ladder through her relationship with Tom, while her husband, George, represents the disillusioned working class. The disdain the Buchanans exhibit towards Myrtle and George underscores this divide.
    
- **Values Rooted in the Past vs Modernity**  
    Gatsby’s obsession with recreating the past conflicts with the modern values of moving forward and accepting change. The Jazz Age represents a departure from pre-WW1 traditions, yet Gatsby’s dream is firmly rooted in his idealized past with Daisy.
    


Both Fitzgerald and Larkin present in their works a clash of values between those with anti-materialistic beliefs and those driven by selfish individualism. Both writers explore contextualized conflicts through different narrative techniques. Fitzgerald uses Nick Carraway’s reflective narration to critique 20th-century American materialism, while Larkin’s poetry employs a more direct, often bitter tone to decry modern life’s emptiness.
