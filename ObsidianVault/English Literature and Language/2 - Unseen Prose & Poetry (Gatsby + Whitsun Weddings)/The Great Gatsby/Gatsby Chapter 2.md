“Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s wife.”

- It’s Mr Wolfshiem who says this.

- What Mr Wolfshiem says isn’t really that true because firstly (assuming he’s talking about daisy as the “friend’s wife) Tom is more of a rival than a friend to Gatsby. A lot of that being because he’s married to Daisy. Even more so Gatbsy does more than just looking at Daisy, so what Mr Wolfshiem is saying is more of a sarcastic comment on the situation.

- Daisy cleary cared about Gatsby if she was willing to go as far as escaping home for a bit to go all thew way to New York just to say goodbye to him.

- She was probably shouted/told off really badly/ her parents were really strict, this might be why she married someone like Tom Buchanan as her family could have had great influence on her marital decisions

“In a way that every young girl wanted to be looked at some time” – Gatsby clearly reciprocated the deep affection Daisy had for him back and their love probably was like how a lot of teenagers want it to be. Perfect.

- Her family probably had a lot of influence on who she married to and the people who she dated with after Gatsby might have been people who her parents set her up with or she carried on dating people she liked but then her previous engagement was forced to end due to her parents wanting her to marry Tom

- Her marriage to Tom was more out of convenience, probably so she could stay wealthy, this reflects into the novel itself as Daisy is still interested in Gatsby and Tom is with another woman too (Myrtle). So their marriage was more for convenience for status, wealth etc.

- The letter in her “other hand” is most probably a love letter from someone, could quite possibly from Gatsby while he was still in the army, she threw it away of course as no one should’ve found out, otherwise it would have been over for her

- If she ever did fall in love with Tom, it was purely for his wealth and status and not himself

- Daisy putting on her pearl necklace symbolises her transition into the life of luxury and a nshut down of her previous feelings she had towards Gatsby

- Jordan only having quickly gone over Daisy’s wedding to Tom shows that there was nothing much that had actually happened, as it was all fake

- Daisy still clearly had her love to Gatsby as Jordan spent a lot more time going on about the events the night before

- Daisy clearly didn’t trust Tom and must have suspected that he was not a very loyal partner to have, she might have already found out that he was having an affair with another woman which could be Myrtle

- It’s then confirmed that he was having an affair as a woman was mentioned being with him in the car crash

- The car crash could also be a possible foreshadow to the car crash that takes place later in the novel outside Gatsby’s house

- He must’ve seen how Daisy was married to Tom for the money and status, so he wanted to compete for her by getting more wealth and power to win her over as he was her original lover.

- Him also moving just across the bay also gives opportunity for their romance to become a thing again.

-  Daisy’s view of love must be quite materialistic if she only goes for people who have money.

-  There was a big idea of coming alive in America during the 1920s where they would constantly be trying to rebirth/reinvent themselves which is what Gatsby was trying to do “He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb”.

- Gatsby not wanting Daisy to know about him ahead of time was probably because he wanted to show himself up to her in a big bang, impress her lots. It’s kind of all meticulously planned inside his head as he wants it to all happen the perfect way.

- When Jordan says that Daisy “ought to have something” it’s probably because she knows there’s not a lot going on for Daisy and that she’s bored. Jordan thinks that she could do with a bit of action that could come from having her romance relit with Gatsby again.
