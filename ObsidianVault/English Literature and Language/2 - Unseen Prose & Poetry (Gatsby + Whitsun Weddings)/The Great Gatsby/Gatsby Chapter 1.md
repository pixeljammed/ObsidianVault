**What are your impressions of Nick’s attitudes and values from this opening section?**
Nick is assumably a very traditional man, following his families values 

**What do we learn about Nick’s experiences and education?**
Nick was raised with privilege, a member of the middle class and has likely led a rather comfortable life. *"remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had"* is something his father said, probably reflecting on his better upbringing - yet he does not hold stereotypical capitalistic beliefs.

"My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations." he's very well off, born into status and probably never experienced hardship in his life is something you might assume, yet he has more socialism-esque values more than anything, and he fought in the great war - albeit not on the frontlines - his status would have never allowed for that, which is apparent on how he refers to it as something enjoyable and how he was bored after *(which is ironic considering the impact of WW1 on some of the soldiers on the frontlines)*

**How does Nick describe his surroundings? What relationship does he seem to have with it?**
He's arguably humble in spite stemming from wealth, instead opting to go earn his own money by "learning the bond business".

- One thing to note here is the class divide which he accurately describes - and the locations which seperate them.
- He notes the community differs greatly, in spite of their almost identical shape and size.
	- The **West Egg** is much more flaunting in their wealth compared to **East Egg**, who don't really like them for said reason.
		- An example of this is Gatsby's great giant mansion, described as a **"copy of a french hotel"**.

- The **West Egg** side is home to the new rich - the more youthful people who have only recently acquired their wealth.

- The **East Egg** side is home to the older people, and money whom has been passed down through many generations.

**The main difference here would be that** the old rich people have more status and connection than the newer ones. Their established presence is very apparent and they also seem a little more "humble" in a sense (if millions of `$$$` seems humble to you lol).
