## Group Work #1
**"You resemble the advertisement" to "touching his coat with her hand".**

The tension, and unease within the room is delicately written - never explicitly said but very apparent from the character's actions - i.e: "he cracked a little", as if to suggests that under the pressure, Tom is struggling to maintain his composure, further backed up by more obvious phrases such as "trembling with his effort at self control".

The lack of answering is also indicative of the high tension and illustrates an awkward room of people.
"A pause followed this apparently pointless remark"
"He didn’t answer."

In addition the crude remarks and significantly more contrasted speech to Gatsby:
Words like **"boisterous", "demanded", "objected"** contrast Gatsby's more gentle language, like how he **suggests** for them all to go into his car. It further emphasises the scene and portrays their

> [!NOTE]- CHAPTER 7 EXTRACT
> “I’ve got something to tell YOU, old sport ——” began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention. “Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?” “That’s a good idea.” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.” “I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.” “Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.” “You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically. Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement. “She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!” At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain — as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions. “Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.” 100 “I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five years — and you didn’t know.” Tom turned to Daisy sharply. “You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?” “Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to laugh sometimes.”— but there was no laughter in his eyes ——” to think that you didn’t know.” “Oh — that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair. “You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then — and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.” “No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head. “She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.” “You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.” Gatsby walked over and stood beside her. “Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the truth — that you never loved him — and it’s all wiped out forever.” She looked at him blindly. “Why — how could I love him — possibly?” “You never loved him.” She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing — and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late. “I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.


**How does Gatsby move from control to out of control over the course of this passage?​**
~~The tension, and unease within the room is delicately written - never explicitly said but very apparent from the character's actions (like daisy being eager to go home).~~

Gatsby is in an initially authorative-like position within the group, both literally and figuratively
Of course, he has more wealth, but he also had the leverage of Daisy and her secret.

His emotional outburst adds a performative quality to the confrontation, almost as if he'd been rehearsing this "revelation" and is now delivering it with eagerness.

Gatsby's attempt to reveal something significant is interrupted by Daisy, creating a sense of suspense and theatricality, but also as if his control over the group is being challenged.
He's trying to assert control over the two but ultimately fails.

When Daisy calls him "revolting" and turns to Nick, Gatsby's self control deteriorates and he becomes desperate, pleaing with her, described as "earnestly" begging her to tell Tom the truth.

**How does Gatsby portray this confrontation as performance**
Gatsby's emotional outburst adds a performative quality to the confrontation, almost as if he'd been rehearsing this "revelation" and is now delivering it with earnestness.

Initially Tom reacts with automatic disbelief; "tapping his thick fingers together like a clergyman". His response seems calm and collected initially, as if he doesn't believe a word of Gatsby's accusations.

The fact it is a performance is backed up by the insistence of Tom and Gatsby of Nick + Jordan to say, as if to suggest that they would like this to be public, almost as if the two are an audience.

**How does Daisy's dialogue begin to change the tone of this passage? How does she bring Nick back more clearly into the narrative?**
While at first Tom reacts with obvious disbelief, Daisy's confirmation seems to almost silence Tom's emotional outburst, and as she turns to Nick as if to move the narrative along, which is a stark difference to how she was at the start, still avoiding the conversation (she interrupts it).
Eventually she shifts into being more assertive, described as having a "thrilling scorn" and acts as if to add fuel to the fire, trying to involve more people like Nick and Jordan and being angry at both Gatsby and Tom, not taking a side, and turning the whole room sour as a result.

She is very torn between the two sides, reflected by her language - for instance described as "looking [at Gatsby] blindly" which is a oxymoron

He does so until Daisy further confirms the claims of Gatsby and at which point his stops withholding and  "explodes" to quote - as he loses control over the conversation (and his temper too) and Gatsby gains it - seemingly in the more authorative position in the conversation as he speaks maturely in contrast.
