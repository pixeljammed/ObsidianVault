In text A, written as an open letter, Karen Jones. Through a personal anecdote of her daughter Skye’s experience with an assistance dog, Jones aims to encourage donations to the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind. The text balances both emotional appeal and factual information to create a compelling case for supporting the cause.

In her writing, Jones uses a wide range of linguistic methods in order to effectively inform and persuade the audience. She addresses the reader directly through the use of personal pronouns like "you" and "we", to create an immediate bond with the reader, making the appeal feel personal and direct. Additionally, emotive language is greatly used, for instances phrases like "constantly terrified" and "brought us together" emphasing her emotivity, while phrases like "you can change everything" and "be a hero too" are designed to empower the reader.
