> [!NOTE]- Essential Beauty
> In frames as large as rooms that face all ways  
And block the ends of streets with giant loaves,  
Screen graves with custard, cover slums with praise  
Of motor-oil and cuts of salmon, shine  
Perpetually these sharply-pictured groves  
Of how life should be. High above the gutter  
A silver knife sinks into golden butter,  
A glass of milk stands in a meadow, and  
Well-balanced families, in fine  
Midsummer weather, owe their smiles, their cars,  
Even their youth, to that small cube each hand  
Stretches towards. These, and the deep armchairs  
Aligned to cups at bedtime, radiant bars  
(Gas or electric), quarter-profile cats  
By slippers on warm mats,  
Reflect none of the rained-on streets and squares  
...
They dominate outdoors. Rather, they rise  
Serenely to proclaim pure crust, pure foam,  
Pure coldness to our live imperfect eyes  
That stare beyond this world, where nothing's made  
As new or washed quite clean, seeking the home  
All such inhabit. There, dark raftered pubs  
Are filled with white-clothed ones from tennis-clubs,  
And the boy puking his heart out in the Gents  
Just missed them, as the pensioner paid  
A halfpenny more for Granny Graveclothes' Tea  
To taste old age, and dying smokers sense  
Walking towards them through some dappled park  
As if on water that unfocused she  
No match lit up, nor drag ever brought near,  
Who now stands newly clear,  
Smiling, and recognising, and going dark.

## Analysis
The poem at a simple level is in relation to advertisements which supposedly "dominate" the outside world, and speaks on how they push and sell a falsified life to an increasingly saddened demographic (think "slums" on line 3).

It touches on the irony of the picture-perfect lies made by corporate promised to us, juxtaposing the quite differing less-than-flawless reality 

When the poem says "seeking the home" it means how the advertisers want to push themself into our very houses, to get close and personal, to further embed their ideas within our minds. 

To live life seeking this false hope is pretty materialistic. No matter what you own you will still be
Your life is not smooth sailing,
