> [!NOTE]- Love Songs in Age
> She kept her songs, they kept so little space,  
> The covers pleased her:  
> One bleached from lying in a sunny place,  
> One marked in circles by a vase of water,  
> One mended, when a tidy fit had seized her,  
> And coloured, by her daughter -  
> So they had waited, till, in widowhood  
> She found them, looking for something else, and stood  
>   
> Relearning how each frank submissive chord  
> Had ushered in  
> Word after sprawling hyphenated word,  
> And the unfailing sense of being young  
> Spread out like a spring-woken tree, wherein  
> That hidden freshness sung,  
> That certainty of time laid up in store  
> As when she played them first. But, even more,  
>   
> The glare of that much-mentionned brilliance, love,  
> Broke out, to show  
> Its bright incipience sailing above,  
> Still promising to solve, and satisfy,  
> And set unchangeably in order. So  
> To pile them back, to cry,  
> Was hard, without lamely admitting how  
> It had not done so then, and could not now.

## Overview
The songs here are sheet music, in a time before radio or television, and people would entertain themself by playing to themself on piano.

In the second stanza plays the music and it evokes a feeling of timelines, and it transports her back to a younger time.

In the final stanza it talks on how it invokes even more than just nostalgia, but rather an emotion of her former love, and she reflects on her life in from the future. It talks about what love "promised" to solve for her but the disillusion and realisation that love could not do all those things and still cannot.
In the end, she puts them away.

## Imagery
**Relearning how each frank submissive chord**
Kind of the image of how music has a power to evoke emotion from people, has connotations in relation to love as well and how we can associate music with it

## Love vs Failure
**What images draw on ideas of love or failure?**
The final stanza discusses how it evokes more than simply nostalgia, but an emotion of her old love, as she reflects on her life in the past. It discusses the problems that love "promised" to fix for her, but also of her disappointment and realisation that love was unable—and still is—to accomplish all of those things.
She eventually puts them away, and laments her failure within love.

**Monosyllabic and Polysyllabic**
The polysyllabic words are typically more excitable and vivid language and veer towards the brighter themes discussed within this topic
For instance:
- Brilliance
- Spring-woken
- Incipience
- Certainty (signifying security, perhaps within a relationship)

Conversely, the single syllabled words are contrastingly dull and reflect upon the more somber tones discussed within the poem, and speak on
