 An Arundel Tomb is a poem written by [[Phillip Larkin]] as part of his collection called [[The Whitsun Weddings]]. This one speaks upon how even after death, love can still be present, at least symbolically, or in memory - how it lives on in spite of a person perhaps passing (aliteration!).

> [!NOTE]- An Arundel Tomb
> Side by side, their faces blurred,  
> The earl and countess lie in stone,  
> Their proper habits vaguely shown  
> As jointed armour, stiffened pleat,  
> And that faint hint of the absurd -  
> The little dogs under their feet.  
>   
> Such plainness of the pre-baroque  
> Hardly involves the eye, until  
> It meets his left-hand gauntlet, still  
> Clasped empty in the other; and  
> One sees, with a sharp tender shock,  
> His hand withdrawn, holding her hand.  
>   
> They would not think to lie so long.  
> Such faithfulness in effigy  
> Was just a detail friends would see:  
> A sculptor's sweet commissioned grace  
> Thrown off in helping to prolong  
> The Latin names around the base.  
>   
> They would no guess how early in  
> Their supine stationary voyage  
> The air would change to soundless damage,  
> Turn the old tenantry away;  
> How soon succeeding eyes begin  
> To look, not read. Rigidly they  
>   
> Persisted, linked, through lengths and breadths  
> Of time. Snow fell, undated. Light  
> Each summer thronged the grass. A bright  
> Litter of birdcalls strewed the same  
> Bone-littered ground. And up the paths  
> The endless altered people came,  
>   
> Washing at their identity.  
> Now, helpless in the hollow of  
> An unarmorial age, a trough  
> Of smoke in slow suspended skeins  
> Above their scrap of history,  
> Only an attitude remains:  
>   
> Time has transfigures them into  
> Untruth. The stone fidelity  
> They hardly meant has come to be  
> Their final blazon, and to prove  
> Our almost-instinct almost true:  
> What will survive of us is love.

## Notes

> [!NOTE]+ Theme: Love
> **How is it depicted positively?**
> Contrary to some of the others things Larkin has written in regards to [[Love]] in his other poems (for example, [[Self's the Man]] being a rather pessimistic view on not just marriage but love as a whole), this poem seems to contrast those thoughts.
> 
>-  He talks about the permanence of things in the world, or rather lack thereof, and ties the them of love in within this.
> - This is most notable within the last line, as he ends the poem with *"What will survive of us is love."*
> -  The hands connecting are a more obvious physical symbol of this - *"holding her hand"*.
> 
> > **Conversely, how is love depicted NEGATIVELY?**
> > It could be argued that it is a little extreme in that regard and perhaps a little restrictive in a sense, perhaps a little "absurb" as the poem accuses.

> [!NOTE]+ Address
> **Consider the significance of the address.**
> Objectively, it seems to me as if he's speaking to himself or just aloud, as if he is looking upon them - simply making an observation of sorts.
>- He reflects upon them in the final stanza and talks on what he can draw from it for himself - "what will survive of us is love", as if to conclude on something for all.
> 
>- You could argue it is also written like a eulogy - but it is not so representative of their characters, and more so like on their bond.
>- Moreso the poem only seems to focus on their love and not as people - the first line reads *"...their faces blurred"*
>
>> **Are there different voices within the poem?**
>> - Not really, it's just assumably Larkin speaking from the
>> - However you could argue *"They would not think to lie so long."* it's a little representative of them as characters perhaps?

> [!NOTE]+ English Devices
> **What sounds predominate? Consider the connotations of assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia, the rhyme scheme.**
> 
> Examples:
> - *Sibilance:* “slow suspended skeins”
> - *Assonance:* “lengths and breadths”
> - *Plosive alliteration:* “time has transfigured them/into Untruth”
> - *ABBCAC rhyme scheme*
> 
> Stuff I found:
> - *Anaphora:* "They would not..." - at the start of a couple stanzas.

This represents the changing seasons and the progression of time; winter, summer and spring. It suggests timelessness; the continued endurance of the statues through the ages.

**Identify the metre of the poem**
The metre of the poem is Iambic Tetrameter

**Note how the established form of the poem is disrupted in stanza five.
What is the intended meaning/effect of this disruption?**
*“A bright / litter of birdcalls strewed the same / Bone-riddled ground”*

## Connection to [[The Great Gatsby Themes]]
You could argue that chapter 6 tells the story of James Gatz's figurative "death" as an identity, as Dan Cody taught James Gatz to be a criminal (specifically bootlegging), and in doing so sealed the "death" of James Gatz and the birth of Jay Gatsby.
This is comparable to the whole of the poem, specifically at the start - as the poem says *"their faces blurred"*
