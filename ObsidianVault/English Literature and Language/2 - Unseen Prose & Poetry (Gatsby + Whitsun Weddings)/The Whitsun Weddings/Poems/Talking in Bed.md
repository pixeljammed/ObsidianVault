> [!NOTE]- Talking in Bed - Phillip Larkin
> Talking in bed ought to be easiest,  
Lying together there goes back so far,  
An emblem of two people being honest.  
Yet more and more time passes silently.  
Outside, the wind's incomplete unrest  
Builds and disperses clouds in the sky,  
And dark towns heap up on the horizon.  
None of this cares for us. Nothing shows why  
At this unique distance from isolation  
It becomes still more difficult to find  
Words at once true and kind,  
Or not untrue and not unkind.

## Analysis

Larkin frequently uses modal auxiliary verbs throughout his writing to suggest a sense of doubt in what should be expected. It's as if to say "it should" - giving the reader an immediate sense that something is off with this.

When he says lying, there could be a hidden second suggestion within:
- lying as in to literally **lie down**
- lying as in to to **tell a lie**

Stereotypically and symbolically people in the past have treated lying in bed with your partner as a time to relax and unwind, yet to treat one another with honesty. Larkin holds this view too, seeing this honesty as an important aspect in a relationship.

In the second stanza he starts off with the converse to what he said before, beginning with "yet" and saying "more and more time passes silently", a feeling of creeping 
He seems to try and distract himself, choosing to focus instead on the weather as opposed to the seemingly failing relationship - but in a pit of irony the climate outside seems to reflect their implied bad relationship.

## Attitude to love
**Talking in bed ought to be easiest,  
Lying together there goes back so far,  
An emblem of two people being honest.**  
Phillip Larkin talks about his expectations for love, how he sees honesty as an important aspect within a relationship. When he sets up and describes the cliche of talking in bed and its association with it, he immediately opposes it with "yet", and speaks on the slow creep of awkwardness catching up within them.

**Outside, the wind's incomplete unrest  
Builds and disperses clouds in the sky**
The imagery all throughout the poem seems to reflect the author's described relationship. He shifts the focus towards the weather as opposed to the seemingly failing relationship - but in a pit of irony the climate outside seems to reflect their implied bad relationship - a prime example of [[pathetic fallacy]].
Additionally, the 

**And dark towns heap up on the horizon.
None of this cares for us. Nothing shows why**
The first line could be reflective of these problems building up and piling as they go unaddressed by the "increasingly silent" couple. The one following is of course an example of Larkin


**It becomes still more difficult to find  
Words at once true and kind,  
Or not untrue and not unkind.**
It isnâ€™t clear whether the speaker is trying to make the relationship work or has any aspiration to improvement. From what is known about the poet's views on relationships, the reader might concur with him that the couple is not at fault. Larkin believed that it is a natural thing for love to fail and die.

The double negatives at the end is an obvious rephrase of the above line, albeit a more convoluted and more masked up way to say it in an apparent desperation, without exactly saying it verbatim.
