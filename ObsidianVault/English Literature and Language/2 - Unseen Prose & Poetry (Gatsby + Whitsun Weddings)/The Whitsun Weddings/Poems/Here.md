The poem Here by [[Phillip Larkin]] is probably a projection of his life within Hull (city within Yorkshire). If you have ever been to the place you would definitely understand. It's the opener to [[The Whitsun Weddings]]

- Long winding roads through fields
- "Isolate villages"
- "Beyond a beach"
- Various depressing sightings

**You'd be hard pressed to tell me this isn't yorkshire.** 

> [!NOTE]- Here
> Swerving east, from rich industrial shadows  
And traffic all night north; swerving through fields  
Too thin and thistled to be called meadows,  
And now and then a harsh-named halt, that shields  
Workmen at dawn; swerving to solitude  
Of skies and scarecrows, haystacks, hares and pheasants,  
And the widening river's slow presence,  
The piled gold clouds, the shining gull-marked mud,  
...
  Gathers to the surprise of a large town:  
Here domes and statues, spires and cranes cluster  
Beside grain-scattered streets, barge-crowded water,  
And residents from raw estates, brought down  
The dead straight miles by stealing flat-faced trolleys,  
Push through plate-glass swing doors to their desires—  
Cheap suits, red kitchen-ware, sharp shoes, iced lollies,  
Electric mixers, toasters, washers, driers—  
...
A cut-price crowd, urban yet simple, dwelling  
Where only salesmen and relations come  
Within a terminate and fishy-smelling  
Pastoral of ships up streets, the slave museum,  
Tattoo-shops, consulates, grim head-scarfed wives;  
And out beyond its mortgaged half-build edges  
Fast-shadowed wheat-fields, running high as hedges,  
Isolate villages where removed lives  
...
Loneliness clarifies. Here silence stands  
Like heat. Here leaves unnoticed thicken,  
Hidden weeds flower, neglected waters quicken,  
Luminously-peopled air ascends;  
And past the poppies bluish neutral distance  
Ends the land suddenly beyond a beach  
Of shapes and shingles. Here is unfettered existence:  
Facing the sun, untalkative, out of reach.

## Brief Analysis
The poem reads almost like a narration of sights, spotted throughout a journey - which it is, because it's implied (yet not stated that!) it's set on a train journey. You could compare this to the march of life as it goes on: time, like trains (and ThamesLink), stops for nobody, and eventually comes to a close, yet another instance of the reoccurring theme of **death** throughout phillip's work. The train journey could be seen as a concluding life, one of that closely similar to the author's own.

## Questions and Answers
**How does this position the speaker in relation to the current subject matter?**
Everyone's life is slowly chugging along similar to a train or a journey. Things happen along the way and events do to, sights and people coming and going and an eventual final destination - our metaphorical deathbed. The train ride depicted here is something everyone can relate to, to an extent.

*As you see these sights there is a slight sense of familliarity, as these are sights you might see every day, but there's also a slight feel of detachment as you view them only through windows for mere seconds.*

**How would you define the tone of the poem? Are there tonal shifts?**

There are many tonal shifts throughout the whole poem:
- Stanza 1
	- Starts out talking about nature - in an almost solemn way, but with rich vocabulary to finish off and phrases like "piled gold clouds" make it seem almost appreciative of the sights placed throughout the journey. Tone then shifts from a more sour and dull tone to 
	- "Haystacks and hares", "skies and scarecrows" is aliteration utilised perhaps to make things seem more repetitive, quite literally - akin to how the same surroundings occur time and time again along the track
-  Stanza 2
	- Here things take a turn, suggesting like he has entered into an industrial town or city
	- oop
	- position 
- Stanza 3
	- pug
	- plug
	- *"Isolated villages, where removed lives"* assumably because the people who live in the little villages in yorkshire are almost 100% old rich tory farts
- Stanza 4
	- In poetry, when talking about standing on the shore, it could have connotations to standing between life and death.

> [!TLDR]+ TL:DR
> He seems rather cynical / hostile towards the urbanized areas, as his language shifts from an appreciative tone at the start when speaking on the countryside, then becoming more sour towards the industrial areas and ending off more favourable, seeming happy in the solidarity of the beach/countryside.

**What places are presented to us as the speaker makes the journey by train?**
He is going east from the midlands towards East Yorkshire, which correlates with the fact [[Phillip Larkin]], the author, lived within Hull (a port city within East Yorkshire)
This would make sense as he first enters a:
- Stanza 1: countryside - 
- Stanza 2: industrial city - 
- Stanza 3: villages -
- Stanza 4: beach/countryside - *"Ends the land suddenly beyond a beach"*

##  
[[Phillip Larkin]] utilised many compound words (words with compounds) within this poem.

- Harsh-named halt
- Cut-price crowd
- Swerving to solitude 
- Haystacks and Hares

Just to name a few.

**From these you could potentially gather...** 
Kind of like iambic pentameter but alliterating?
Could be considered anaphoric or alliterative but not really.
The ones like haystacks and hares, swerving to solitude, are sibilance.
