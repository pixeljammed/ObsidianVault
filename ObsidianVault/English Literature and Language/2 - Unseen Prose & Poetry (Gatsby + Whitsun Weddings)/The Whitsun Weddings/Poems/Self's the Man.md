> [!NOTE] Self's the Man - [[Phillip Larkin]]
> Oh, no one can deny  
That Arnold is less selfish than I.  
He married a woman to stop her getting away  
Now she’s there all day,
...
And the money he gets for wasting his life on work  
She takes as her perk  
To pay for the kiddies’ clobber and the drier  
And the electric fire,
...
And when he finishes supper  
Planning to have a read at the evening paper  
It’s Put a screw in this wall –  
He has no time at all,
...
With the nippers to wheel round the houses  
And the hall to paint in his old trousers  
And that letter to her mother  
Saying Won’t you come for the summer
...
To compare his life and mine  
Makes me feel a swine:  
Oh, no one can deny  
That Arnold is less selfish than I.
...
But wait, not do fast:  
Is there such a contrast?  
He was out for his own ends  
Not just pleasing his friends;
...
And if it was such a mistake,  
He still did it for his own sake,  
Playing his own game.  
So he and I are the same,  
Only I’m a better hand  
At knowing what I can stand!
