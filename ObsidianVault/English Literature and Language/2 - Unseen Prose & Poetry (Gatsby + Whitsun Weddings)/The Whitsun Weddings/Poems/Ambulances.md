> [!NOTE]- Ambulances
> Closed like confessionals, they thread  
> Loud noons of cities, giving back  
> None of the glances they absorb.  
> Light glossy grey, arms on a plaque,  
> They come to rest at any kerb:  
> All streets in time are visited.  
>   
> Then children strewn on steps or road,  
> Or women coming from the shops  
> Past smells of different dinners, see  
> A wild white face that overtops  
> Red stretcher-blankets momently  
> As it is carried in and stowed,  
>   
> And sense the solving emptiness  
> That lies just under all we do,  
> And for a second get it whole,  
> So permanent and blank and true.  
> The fastened doors recede. Poor soul,  
> They whisper at their own distress;  
>   
> For borne away in deadened air  
> May go the sudden shut of loss  
> Round something nearly at an end,  
> And what cohered in it across  
> The years, the unique random blend  
> Of families and fashions, there  
>   
> At last begin to loosen. Far  
> From the exchange of love to lie  
> Unreachable inside a room  
> The traffic parts to let go by  
> Brings closer what is left to come,  
> And dulls to distance all we are.
