> [!NOTE]- Mr Bleaney - Poem
> 
This was Mr Bleaney's room. He stayed  
The whole time he was at the Bodies, till  
They moved him.' Flowered curtains, thin and frayed,  
Fall to within five inches of the sill,
...
Whose window shows a strip of building land,  
[Tussocky](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/207833#eid17212545), littered. 'Mr Bleaney took  
My bit of garden properly in hand.'  
Bed, upright chair, sixty-watt bulb, no hook
...
Behind the door, no room for books or bags --  
'I'll take it.' So it happens that I lie  
Where Mr Bleaney lay, and stub my fags  
On the same saucer-souvenir, and try
...
Stuffing my ears with cotton-wool, to drown  
The jabbering set he egged her on to buy.  
I know his habits -- what time he came down,  
His preference for sauce to gravy, why
...
He kept on plugging at the four aways --  
Likewise their yearly frame: the Frinton folk  
Who put him up for summer holidays,  
And Christmas at his sister's house in Stoke
...
But if he stood and watched the frigid wind  
Tousling the clouds, lay on the fusty bed  
Telling himself that this was home, and grinned,  
And shivered, without shaking off the dread
...
That how we live measures our own nature,  
And at his age having no more to show  
Than one hired box should make him pretty sure  
He warranted no better, I don't know.

​​**What relationship does the persona have to Mr Bleaney?**
Mr Bleaney is probably a projection of Phillip Larkin's life - most likely on how he was the former resident / tenant of an apartment - like the small, solitary Hull apartment that [[Phillip Larkin]] worked in for latter half of his rather miserable life.

**How does Larkin use reported speech to create a layered narrative voice?**
Larkin uses reported speech (talking as in the past) to create a backstory of sorts and a mystery alongside it - raising questions who was Mr Bleaney, what happened to him. He speaks as if it is his legacy, almost like a eulogy spoken at his funeral. And even if he didn't die (no hard evidence in the poem) it still sounds a terrible fate, a room not like a home, fit to rot away in.

**How is the rented room described by the landlady and the persona? Do these descriptions complement or contradict each other?**
The whole time he was at the Bodies (bodies: body, like a body car shop, the automobile industry) he stayed here, not living here by choice, determined by the job.

**What impression does the persona give of Mr Bleaney? What evidence does he have for this?​**
Mr Bleaney was a sad man with little to no aspiration in life. He lets his life be determined or even dic

**What impression does the persona give of his own character? Is this deliberate or more accidental?**
Mr Bleaney is like a look into the writer's future for him. Now that he lies there at the same age and same place and he knows what the future held for whom was ahead of him, it leaves him to think and reflect on his life, and ultimately the irony and failure and exasperation of it. It's sad because his life is doomed to repeat and it may have just only set in.
