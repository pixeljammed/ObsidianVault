> [!NOTE]- The Large Cool Store
> The large cool store selling cheap clothes  
Set out in simple sizes plainly  
(Knitwear, Summer Casuals, Hose  
In browns and greys, maroon and navy)  
Conjures the weekday world of those  
> 
Who leave at dawn low terraced houses  
Timed for factory, yard and site.  
But past the heaps of shirts and trousers  
Spread the stands of Modes For Night:  
Machine-embroidered, thin as blouses,  
>
Lemon, sapphire, moss-green, rose  
Bri-Nylon Baby Dolls and Shorties  
Flounce in clusters. To suppose  
They share that world, to think their sort is  
Matched by something in it, shows  
>
How separate and unearthly love is,  
Or women are, or what they do,  
Or in our young unreal wishes  
Seem to be: synthetic, new  
And natureless in ecstasies.

## Brief Analysis
Larkin presents a negative attitude, very much so reflective of his uppity and pessimistic attitude, towards these clothes. He talks about how the nightclothes to him seem rather cheap and without any feel to him, calling them *"synthetic"*, making them out to be a shoddy attempt to get the lower class to buy into a lifestyle *"natureless in ecstasies"* as he puts it.

## Abundance
The clothes described are cheap and mass produced, for the masses, as opposed to a richer person's personally tailored clothes - "set out in simple sizes".

"Past the heaps" suggest the sheer number of these being not in demand by any mean 

He calls them "synthetic, new, and natureless" like a manufactured poor imitation of a lifestyle akin to the upper classes, tailored towards the lowerclass who still might long for ithaat
