**What is the journey?**
- In [[Here]] the journey is a train journey, read similarly to a travelogue, as [[Phillip Larkin]] travels through yorkshire/hull and sees many things like industrial areas and little villages and nature, and comments on how they all have a different type of beauty. 
	- Through the repetition of the word here he highlights its ambiguity, and how home is a vastly different place for all.
- In [[The Whitsun Weddings]] the journey is similar to the poem above, as it depicts Larkin going on a train ride, on the Whitsun. He seems many wedding parties come on and off and talks almost enviously of them but also in spite. 
	- It's like he learns that marriages are nothing special - in his signature cynical tone.
- In [[The Importance of Elsewhere]]
