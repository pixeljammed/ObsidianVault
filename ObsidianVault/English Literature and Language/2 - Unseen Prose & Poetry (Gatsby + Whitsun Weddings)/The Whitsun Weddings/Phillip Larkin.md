Phillip Larkin was a famous poet and the figurehead of [[The Movement]] during the 1960s, as well as the head librarian of the university of Hull.


His poems are full of emotion and feeling, yet the man himself was absolutely dull. He came off to others as a pessimist, completely void of happiness (i'm not overdramatising this he was completely horrible)

## Personal Life

His early life as a child was as expected, he was supposedly increasingly shy. His household was more of the same, with his father apparently neglectful towards his mother and sister... matter of fact his dad was a **fucking in the flesh Nazi** and **"hated everything foreign"**. Phillip described his parent's marriage as loveless and drab.

His peers described him as **"incapable of love"** and 

He only really kept one good friend alongside him, a fellow writer, whom shared the same views as him and I'm not saying he was **gay** but it definitely sounds it. They frequently exchanged letters between themself, of which expressed their views on life and women, of which were so extreme he'd probably be considered a modern day incel or get him put on a watchlist at the very least


Later in his life Phillip moved to Hull. This alone **explains absolutely everything**. *If you have ever been to the shithole yourself you'd understand.*  Hull is a sad little corner of england which seemingly reinforced his rut, and. Strangely enough, Hull was where he was happiest *(ironically)*, where he lived solemnly in a small, single bedroom solidary flat overlooking the city. He finally had his life in order and it was where he produced his most acclaimed poetry.

Contempt and happy in his self inflicted isolation, Phillip rarely ever left Hull

As a career Phillip was famously a librarian, a job which he excelled at, something he was focused on as it seemed to "give him a satisfaction". He liked the quiet and straightforward work and this was probably something he got from his dad - a strict work ethic.

Phillip Larkin had a girlfriend, Monika Jones, already, someone whom he went back 10 years and a university lecturer. She accepted Phillip as someone who was rather self absorbed.
However he also had a mistress, and struggled to balance his time between the two and in his usual fashion didn't want to commit to either, a reoccurring theme throughout his life.

Larkin seemed unable to be satisfied at success. Even in his fame and international, he was unhappy and he felt exasperated at all. He said himself he considered himself "just an anonymous figure who would die unloved and unrecognised, (his) death strung up in the newspaper solely as "hull man dies".".

His mother was the one thing that he seemingly could not avoid, and exasperated him. She served as a looming reminder of his creeping old age, something he would write about in the poems.


> [!NOTE]+ The Old Fools
> What do they think has happened, the old fools,  
To make them like this? Do they somehow suppose  
It's more grown-up when your mouth hangs open and drools,  
And you keep on pissing yourself, and can't remember  
Who called this morning? Or that, if they only chose,  
They could alter things back to when they danced all night,  
Or went to their wedding, or sloped arms some September?  
Or do they fancy there's really been no change,  
And they've always behaved as if they were crippled or tight,  
Or sat through days of thin continuous dreaming  
Watching light move? If they don't (and they can't), it's strange:  
Why aren't they screaming?

After years of illness, Eva Larkins (his mother), died in a nursing home in the 1980s. It was one of the first many events that seemed to genuinely move and effect him. Aged only 55, after this happening, he wrote very little poetry, or anything at all, and he fell even deeper into a horrible depression.
However it did push him to write one last thing - his magnum opus to him, something he had struggled to finish for a while.

> I work all day, and get half-drunk at night.     
Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare.     
In time the curtain-edges will grow light.     
Till then I see what’s really always there:     
Unresting death, a whole day nearer now,     
Making all thought impossible but how     
And where and when I shall myself die.     
Arid interrogation: yet the dread  
Of dying, and being dead,  
Flashes afresh to hold and horrify.

In his last days, Phillip Larkin was miserable, and even turned down being a poem laureate

He had contracted cancer within his oesophagus and it was spreading fast. Reportedly he both looked forward to death and was afraid of it, but it was something he could not avoid.
### All in all considered, how did this guy get more pussy than me?

## Themes and writing influence
Aside from his personal life obviously, he seemingly wrote about topics which concerned him

Published in 1955, 
The poems themselves were described as beautiful 

Phillip Larkins poems were famously bleak and hopeless, the man himself saying "**I've said that depression is to me as daffodils were to Wordsworth**"

Phillip Larkins was very aware of death supposedly, he seemed very focused on the topic yet fearful of it for himself.
