The movement refers to a group of English only writers, [[Phillip Larkin]] included, of whom were all concerned in regards to english poetry. These people focused on shifting poetry back to its more traditional roots - which to them meant, good, meaningful and simple, and most of all conventional.
Their main objective was to prove the importance of the traditional english language and literature as opposed to the more modern and had less depth, as they argued.

It is important to note that they were opposed to the modern literature, instead choosing to write in an older manner which is definitely noticeable in their works!
