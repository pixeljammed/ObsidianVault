## Planning

- Materialism is the trait in humans to appreciate and value material possessions above all others.
	- I feel like it is embedded within our society's nature for materialism to be present within all - and is also the assumable reason why capitalism seems to prevail above all - as it breeds innovation for better or worse.


>“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “Everybody thinks so — the most advanced people. And I KNOW. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated — God, I’m sophisticated!”

- Daisy says this within Chapter 1
	- This kind of presents Daisy as a shallow person, proclaiming herself as rich and admired, 

>Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich — nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms — but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York.” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.

## Rough Draft

The theme of materialism is quite prevailing within both [[For Sidney Bechet]] and [[Gatsby Chapter 2]], as both Larkin and Nick hold a similar view in regards to their associates' partners.
Phillip talks in regards to how at a party he does not feel like others, acting fairly reserved and instead choosing to appreciate the jazz music of the party, feeling enchanted by the flow of music as opposed to the rather material things in contrast of his associates, such as the "house girls" described, likewise to Nick's view on their rather objectified wives, as his sense of self seems lacking at this point in the story, still not fully confident in himself.

In the poem [[For Sidney Bechet]] though, the last 2 lines of the 3rd stanza read "Others may license, grouping around their chairs, sporting house girls like circus tigers", which is similar to the themes present throughout the Great Gatsby, where the rapidly changing role of women within an american society could be seen being modernised (i.e: Daisy). In the 1920-1940s, around when both Larkin and Fitzgerald were around to write, post war both countries were imbued with reckless extravagance, when America was at an era where social and moral values were decayed. The men depicted as "sporting house girls" is a textbook symbol of objectiveness in people, likewise, how Daisy says "And I hope she’ll be a fool" in regards to a little girl, as if to submit to these post-WW1 American beliefs - as it may just be an easier life for her, to be overlooked, and considered only for looks.

## Final Write-up

The theme of materialism is quite prevailing within both the poem [[For Sidney Bechet]] and [[Gatsby Chapter 2]], as both Larkin and Nick hold a similar view in regards to their associates' partners.

Phillip talks in regards to how at a party he does not feel like others, acting fairly reserved and instead choosing to appreciate the jazz music of the party, feeling "enchanted by the flow of music" as opposed to the rather material things in contrast of his associates, such as the "house girls" described, similarly to Nick's view on their rather objectified wives. This is assumably so as his sense of self seems lacking at this point in the story, still not fully convinced in himself, seemingly still unconvinced with his new identity at this point in the story.


In the poem [[For Sidney Bechet]] though, the last 2 lines of the 3rd stanza read "Others may license, grouping around their chairs, sporting house girls like circus tigers", which is similar to the themes present throughout the Great Gatsby, where the rapidly changing role of women within an american society could be seen being modernised (i.e: Daisy).
In the 1920-1940s, around when both Larkin and Fitzgerald were around to write, post war both countries were **imbued with reckless extravagance**, when America was at an era where social and moral values were decayed. The men depicted as "sporting house girls" is a textbook symbol of objectiveness in people, likewise, how Daisy says "And I hope she’ll be a fool" in regards to a little girl, as if to submit to these post-WW1 american beliefs - as it may just be *an easier life for her, to be overlooked, and considered only for looks.* 

Another poem by Larkin in connection to this could be [[Self's the Man]], where he speaks on both the theme of marriage from a rather cynical perspective.
This is comparative to the character/role of Nick within Gatsby as he holds a judgemental view on the relationships between his rich companions and their respective partners, often speaking in the narrative on the Tom and his wife and mistress in a reflective manner.

In self's the man, talking in regard to his mate Arnold's marriage, he says
**"He married a woman to stop her getting away
Now she’s there all day"**
..of which he implies that she's been trapped into this marriage and it's furthermore a burden on both of their lives, which is comparable to the one of Tom and Daisy - the affair where he "\[had] some woman in New York". Additionally it also suggests a lack of identity for both their partners, where they are very much glossed over by their husbands - think how Larkin mentions her as "a woman".


To an extent, both Gatsby and many of the poems within The Whitsun Weddings can be seen as social critiques. While Gatsby is fictional unlike Larkin's work, both speak miles on a very real human trait, such behavior although morally wrong, thrives in the world of capitalism, as evidenced by Gatsby.

It is embedded within our society's nature for materialism to be present within all - and is also the assumable reason why capitalism seems to prevail above all - as it breeds innovation for better or worse. The books seem to suggest at a simple level, neither the rich nor poor will ever be at peace with themself, never truly satisfied.
