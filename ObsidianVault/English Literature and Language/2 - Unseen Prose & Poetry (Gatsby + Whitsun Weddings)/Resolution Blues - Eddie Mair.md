> No, of course it isn’t. Too many times we’ve both experienced the shimmering hope afforded by the gleaming newness of January 1st, only to have our knees grazed as we tumble headfirst onto the gravel of reality.

> Apologies for that rather purple prose. Just finishing the last of the Christmas sherry. It has a tang to it. I don’t think it’s from this Christmas. I’m not completely certain it’s sherry.

> Over the years I’ve made countless new year resolutions only to break them before the end of Auld Lang Syne. Be nicer to everyone: failed. Be nicer to people at work: failed. Be nicer to Vaughan Savidge and stop making personal remarks about him: failed, though the old git deserved it.
> 
> Any of the permanent changes I’ve made my life have never begun on January 1st; aside from the gloom, the cold and the dregs of the festive feast, there’s the relentless pressure of having to live up to the daft promises we collectively make on December 31st. New Year resolutions are officially a thing, and publicly giving up on them meets with the same response  as if you’d drowned a kitten or criticised the Queen.

> The calendar taunts by counting the number of days you’ve grimly kept your resolve. January 2nd, Day Two. Your second day of going without. It grinds on. January 3rd. Is it only three days? It’s another whole year until I can do this again.

> Our celebrity culture does not help. Now, in addition to the encouragement of well-meaning friends and colleagues, famous people have got in on the act. Their fitness programmes and diet regimes are much better than those offered by fully qualitied nutritionists or doctors because they have agents. And it’s great motivation. It’s one thing to disappoint ourselves, but to let down a celebrity we’ve seen on TV and to whom we’ve indirectly given money. Unthinkable!

> I WONDER WHETHER the gloom of January is the right moment for a fresh start in anything. It’s hard to see the sunlit uplands of tomorrow when there’s only there hours of daylight and it’s too cold to be outside for longer than five minutes. Wouldn’t spring be a better time for us to forge our resolutions? Howsabout April 6th. A New Financial Year Resolution! The clocks will have changed, the evenings will be lighter and accountants everywhere will be partying like they’ve just landed the Apple contract for running an office in Jersey.

> Yes, why not ditch the constraints of our traditional calendar and live the way HMRC does? I can already smell the fresher air, see the dew glistening on the gravel and the choirs singing something Gregorian.

## Notes
**Purpose**
It's a commentary on our desires to improve our own selves which often falls flat. The author believes the tradition of new years resolution is fruitless. The typical person would've struggled 

He also critiques celebrity culture

**Target audience**
The target audience would be a 

**Context**


#### Annotations

The writer makes heavy use of irony through words like "survived", "standing" and "stooped". The aliteration of these words in the opening sentence has an effect, as the stark difference between all 3 words's meaning yet similar pronunciation, encapsulating reader's experiences of the year, both good and bad.

Repetition (anaphora) of the word new - followed by words like "horizon", "goals" and "resolution" connects the start of a year with hope.

The rhetorical question "isn't it exciting" after makes the reader think - that they might already know how their newfound resolutions and hope for the new year quickly falls flat.

He then immediately answers the question, 

His lexis and grammatical structure of the 3rd paragraph untenses the tone, and adds a sense of intimacy between the reader - through phrases like "Apologies..." and the mention of "christmas sherry" having a tang to it

There's a parrallel syntax here, with the "Be nicer to..." repeated time again.

#### Society and the individual

## Writing

> [!NOTE] Aim
> - Write 3 analytical paragraphs (100 words) including 4 technical terms with modification. Ex: deliberately exaggerated metaphor.
> - The first, establishing the **audience, purpose and context** of the text.
> - The second, exploring how Mair first conveys a sense that he is addressing a **sympathetic audience.**
> - The third, which explores the different forms of writing/different voices of used in this text (though it is written as a comment piece it "borrows" from different genres such as diary mode, asides for self-reflection)

In this opinion piece, Eddie Mair produces a commentary on the futility he and many other readers have assumably felt towards the long standing tradition of new years, discussing the lack of change and feeling of guilt coming from it, that he believes is only exacerbated further by celebrities televising their resolutions too. 
The piece is intended for a general audience, and Mair creates an intimate voice through conversational language, like "Apologies for that \[rather prudent] prose."

The language choice and grammar of Mair also suggests he addresses a sympathetic audience through the constant use of the second person (use of the pronoun "you"). His lexis in 3rd paragraph elicits a warmer tone, and adds a sense of intimacy between the reader - through phrases like "Apologies..." and the few mentions of "Christmas sherry" having a tang to it. Trivial details like this giving an authentic, conversational tone to the writing/voice, suggesting that he is overall, addressing a sympathetic audience.

The text borrows stylistic elements from various genres. Mair adopts a diary-like mode at times, revealing inner thoughts as though confessing to the reader, while also employing asides to inject moments of self-reflection. For example, the mention serves as both a personal anecdote and a commentary on whom we look up to. This genre blending, paired with the informal, anecdotal tone, makes the piece feel like both a public critique and a personal conversation. By borrowing from these different genres, Mair enhances the voice of the piece, making it more accessible and relatable.
