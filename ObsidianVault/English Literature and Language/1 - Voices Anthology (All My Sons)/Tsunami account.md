At the time of this article's publication the event was a massive event - think akin to 9/11 - that was all over the new. This is alluded to in this article by the fact it begins with "this" - as if the reader needs no introduction, it's something they are familiar with.
The piece is structured as if it is almost like a diary entry - like how the author says "day 15" as if it were just another day. The atrocities he sees seem to get worse and worse as he goes on with each paragraph, phrases and numbers seemingly getting bigger every time. After the rhetorical, he pivots around into the better half of things - speaking on how emergency aid is doing their best, and assumably some American bias thanks to patriotism (remember - reportage can be biased!)

"Everyone is very impressed with the US military"
"...and say how thankful they are of the American military"

He talks from a first hand perspective, making use of 1st person pronouns like "I" and "We" when in reference to what he sees. For instance the phrase "everywhere I go I have to be careful I don't step on a corpse" -  a phrase so wild it would almost seem outlandish to most it seems unimaginable or exaggerated, and while perhaps it could be to entertain/excite the audienceit seems something just aboutt fathomable for an accident of this scale.
