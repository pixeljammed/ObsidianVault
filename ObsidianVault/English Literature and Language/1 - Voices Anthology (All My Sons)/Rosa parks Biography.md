## Notes
Remember, a biography is written about a person by a different person.
Autobiographies like [[De Profundis]] or [[Maya Angelou]] are written by the person themself.


**Conventions**
- Written in third person
- Use of past tense
- Overview of subject's life
- Precise and knowledgeable account of events
- Chronological structure
- Use of direct speech from subject of biography as well as those who knew them
- Formal register
- Use of passive voice contributing to an apparently objective stance
- Elements reminiscent of narrative fiction 

**How this text meets those conventions**
- Po

**Writer's perspective on Rosa Parks**
- po

**Critically evaluate how the writer of this biography of Rosa Parks engages the reader with their exploration of Rosa Parks' life and their perspective on the event described.**


**What does the writer say about society and the individual**
I think the writer tries to communicate the idea that the bus driver isn't really at fault - by giving us a later interview from him. He was simply following what he had to do, humanising him and showing how it was simply the societal norm at the time, not that he was a strong willed racist.
The writer also humanises Rosa Parks too - at the beginning he vocalises her actions  

**Grammatical and Lexical choices**
There is a strong semantic field of oppression and the opposition... words like **forebears** and **abolitionist** which puts us in her position in a way, and builds up the language 
It also brings to life
There is heavy use of direct speech, assumably because this is historical, which captures the voices of the characters and brings them to life. It brings to life the southern voices and harsh language used, highlighting just how bad some things said to black people really were.

- Third person omniscient narration, including focalisation (on Rosa Parks and the bus driver); shifts in perspective.
- Shifts in register
- Reporting clauses to illustrate character
- Use of direct speech
- Use of compound sentences
- Evaluative lexis eg: "majestic" and "dignified"
