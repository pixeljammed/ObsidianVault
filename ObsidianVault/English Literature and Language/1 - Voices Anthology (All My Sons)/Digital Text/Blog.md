A blog is a form of writing, typically on the internet, in a mannerism similar to a diary. Typically entries, or articles, are written by a singular blog author. They could be about something personal, or be a daily entry about life or maybe something more specialist, regarding a subject or concept - it depends really, and the spectrum is really wide

## History
Blogs first began around (and peaked) the start of the 2nd millenium - and admittedly have lost their popularity slowly ever since as readers drift away in favour of other personal writing mediums like vlogs and YouTube videos, TikToks, tweets etc..
In the early days of the internet however, blogs were king - this is even reflected in our horrendously outdated education system here in the UK - where you can be asked to write a blog entry in a GCSE exam. Many people have had blogs - and quite a few live on! But their glory days are over and they are overshadowed by the more newer forms of media we have nowadays.

Normally other internet people will read the blog through a personal website - hosted on a domain like www.personsname.com, and sometimes people are free to write their thoughts through comments.
Sometimes blogs can post someone's experience with something or detail a process from a personal account - which could be valuable for a person trying the same thing! Or it could be in regards to something like cooking and perhaps recipies are provided alongside. It is a very broad term spanning a lot of things.
