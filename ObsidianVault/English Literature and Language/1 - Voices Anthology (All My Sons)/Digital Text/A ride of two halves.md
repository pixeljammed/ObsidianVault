The passage is structured very linearly, shifting the focus bit by bit and dedicated a paragraph per "landmark" or whenever he changes road. He utilises words like "by now" and "after" as well as "next" to make it seem almost as if he's telling a story or walking 

Uses longer sentences like "Andalucia is both beautiful and barren in equal measure" in order to set and describe the scene whilst short sentences are typically reserved to describe what he's doing per line.
