## Structure
All paragraphs are structured through bringing up a problem, talking about it, and saying what he's going to do.

"So let us begin anew" - as well as referencing how he wishes to "begin anew" in his presidency it has a connotation as a discourse marker, acting as a divider in the speech. This is also repeated in the 5th paragraph "...both sides begin anew..."

For the first 5 paragraphs he addresses 5 different people - beginning with "To those \_\_\_\_ people" and then gives a more depth description

He uses the word "pledge" - the word has connotations of patriotism and implies a promise in the word, almost a vow.

He uses the word "let us" - like asking permission instead of demanding - almost passive.
There is a sense of togetherness from the pronoun us, saying how all the American citizens need to do it let it happen.

Words like "power", "destroy", "preserve" have a violent, plosive sound to them, and elicit the choice America would like to have when it comes to nations / control. They want absolute control.

-----

**Audience**
The primary audience is American citizens - he gives them a 'priority' in the speech
The entire world is the secondary audience, so he wants to appeal to foreign powers as well, however he wants to elicit a feeling of power and attractiveness of his country.

**Purpose**
The primary purpose of the speech is to address foreign powers in the world, and thereby give Americans confidence in him and their country, and paint America as an attractive power of its own.
He is careful not to polarize his audience and lean too far into one narrative - his stance on world events tailored in this speech to appeal to as many voters and non-voters possible.

## Planning

Citizens of America, subscribers to The New York Times. It is an [[Obituary overview|Obituary]]. Following the conventions of the genre the writer uses sympathetic and reflective language. It quotes him and introduces, commendates his actions to the audience. Departing from an obituary, it's more emotional i.e: "devastating news that engulfed all America and the world".
