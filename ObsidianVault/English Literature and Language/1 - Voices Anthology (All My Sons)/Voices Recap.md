## [[De Profundis]]
De Profundis is a deeply personal letter written by writer Oscar Wilde during his imprisonment, reflecting on his suffering, past mistakes, and personal identity. It serves as both a confession and a meditation on art, love, and redemption. As an autobiography, it follows conventions synonymous with the genre, such as first-person narration, introspection, and a focus on key life events, even though it was originally intended as a letter to his lover.

## [[Maya Angelou]]
In Me and Mum and Mum and Me, Maya Angelou explores her differing relationship with her mother, their standards of living and the traditional fondness or love shared between a child and mother. Maya uses symbolism, presenting food in ways like 
It follows the conventions associated with autobiographies like first-person narration and personal 

I think there are two main journeys Maya makes within the extract/autobiography.
1. One physically (travelling to her Mother's home)
2. One emotionally - healing her relationship and detachment with her mother. The journey is between her childhood and growing up to see or appreciate her mother. The motif of the food (i.e: "emblazoned on \[her] tongue") throughout her childhood contrasts greatly with opening food . The food is almost a celebration of her heritage.

Angelou’s writing often shifts between poetic and conversational tones, creating a dynamic and engaging voice. She sometimes adopts an intimate, almost spoken-word style, which draws the reader in, making them feel as though they are being personally confided in.

- Example: _“She was so beautiful. I had never seen a woman so beautiful.”_ – The repetition and simplicity reflect a child’s awe and wonder, making the moment feel immediate and personal.

Her conversational tone often makes the narrative feel warm and familiar, as if the reader is part of her personal reflections.

- Both Mandela’s speech and Angelou’s autobiography address the struggles of Black individuals under systems of racial discrimination; Mandela under apartheid, and Angelou under segregation in the U.S.
- Mandela’s speech is a call for political and social change, whereas Angelou’s autobiography focuses on personal growth and relationships, overcoming things.
- Both texts use personal experiences to highlight societal issues but on differing levels. Mandela discusses the impact of segregation laws on families, referring to them as a whole "children wander around", "thousands of Africans", while Angelou reflects on how racism shaped her **personal** childhood and family, almost like a anecdote complimenting Mandela's speech.
- Mandela’s speech is formal, structured, and argumentative, aimed at persuading a grouped audience, while Angelou’s autobiography is more reflective, emotional, and intimate, and designed to engage readers on a intimate/personal level.
