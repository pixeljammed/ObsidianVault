Analysis of Brooker’s creation of Voice 

Try to find examples of each of these linguistic approaches and devices in Brooker’s creation of voice: 

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Linguistic Device or Approach|Example(s)|Analyse its effect and impact on the audience|
|Ironic/ sarcastic tone|Yelling out the window at passersby is another option.|The obvious absurdism in this statement makes it apparent to the reader that this is more of a joke than a serious comparison – in a sort of “dry humour” manner.|
|Hyperbole|"Half a million wry tweets (…) photoshop meme about it circulating by lunchtime"|Conveys the absurd/ humorous nature of humans- self-reflective in a way, portrays the foolish behaviour in our modernised society|
|Humour|Olympic-level navel gazing"  <br><br>"There are exits all over this building."  <br><br>"Yelling out the window at passerby is another option."|Inappropriate / laughable- acting as a relief/ ease upon his serious argument.  <br><br>In some cases, intrigues the audience to read on, and welcoming/informal aura created.|
|Sustained semantic field/ Imagery|"Carbon emissions"  <br><br>"Vast cloud"  <br><br>"Factory mindlessly pumping carbo dioxide into the toxic sky"|Provides an enthesis on his message- that blabbering and miscommunication upon the internet is not beneficial and, in some ways, foolish and damaging|
|Cohesion|Reader comments form part of the overall wordstorm described above|Cohesion refers to the way in which words are structured together to create meaning – in this case the “described above” is in direct reference to the paragraphs he wrote about previously, and later coming back to reference it.|
|Direct address of ‘his’ audience|“you’re a human being with free who will stop reading any time. Here, has a full stop. And another. And another. There are exits all over this building.”|Establishes a relationship between reader and writer that is much more personal than a regular news report or article, which makes the reader feel more connected.|
|Bathos|“This led to an intense flurry of activity, by which I mean four people asked me about it.”|Self-deprecating humour that furthers his point about feeling like an unimportant producer of unimportant content.|
|Colloquial register|“I’ve recently been overwhelmed by the sheer amount of jabber in the world: a vast cloud of blah”|Gives the article a conversational tone, making him seem more genuine or human, as well as creating the quality that he’s a friend that the reader is allowing to rant.|
|Anadiplosis (Greek: “doubling” or “repetition,”) <br><br>Parentheses(a word or phrase inserted as an explanation or afterthought into a passage)|"...to switch off the reader comments underneath my articles (not true), and that he’d refused to do so (also not true), so I’d quit (not entirely true).”|Adds comedy to the article by inserting a pedantic tone, further emphasising the rant-like feeling of the article. It also ensures the reader understands that this is not true, leaving no room for miscommunication.|
|Triadic structure(a sentence containing a series of three words, phrases or clauses)|“Now get out.”|Creates a curt and practical tone, often associated with older people. This enforces his point about being out of touch.|
|Ironic understatement|“Getting slagged off online is par for the course”|This could be talking about how backlash people face when putting their opinions on the web anywhere, not just on articles (such as twitter, like author says). To say “slagged off” would be an understatement as there are much worse things commonplace for people to say online|
|Intertextuality|“...when a paragraph in Private Eye claimed...” <br><br>“Although the Private Eye story wasn’t completely wrong”|Intertextuality works best when it is directly referred to and then later less implicitly alluded to later down in the text. Here is might make. The reader feel invested or even “connected” to the writer in a sense because he talks about his older works here direct – it's not just a detached article irrelevant of all the others.|
|Minor/Fragment sentence|“Now get out”|Helps to convey a personal feeling or more informal feeling to the article – like you directly are being addressed as the audience.|
||||
|Range of sentence types (eg imperative, interrogative)|“Now get out.” <br><br>“There are exits all over this building.” <br><br>“Its just weird. I don’t get it”|Short sentences convey seriousness or legitimate pointlessness/ humour|
|Neologism|“word emissions” <br><br>“vast cloud of blah”|You could argue that these phrases or terms are in a way, creating these new phrases by making a play on words – talking about|
|Generic conventions: where does Brooker meet these?  Where does he subvert them?|“Too much talk for one planet (…)” <br><br>(Add more to this plz)|Informative at the beginning- “guardian” article logo mentioned, while also his personal details upon his journalism absence  <br><br>Headline- bold/ attracts interest|
|Try to find a further 3 devices or linguistic features.|“Olympic-level navel gazing” <br><br>“Events and noise. Events and noise; everything was starting to resemble nothing but events and noise”|Metaphor- again to provide humour and exaggerate circumstances to show its importance.  <br><br>Repetition- exaggerating how social media communication is pointless resulting to just inaudible words/ voices|
