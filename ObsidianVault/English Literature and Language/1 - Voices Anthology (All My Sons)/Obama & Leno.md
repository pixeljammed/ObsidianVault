This was an extract from the Television broadcast in 2013 between Jay Leno, host of the NBC's **The Tonight Show**, and Barack Obama, (formerly) the president of the United States

-----
## Context
The Tonight Show is a prominent American television show and has run for many years, with the host passing down, in particular Jay Leno only ran until 2014 until it was run by the current host, Jimmy Fallon.
The Tonight Show (with Jay Leno) tends to have a format of interviewing famous people on some questions, with comedy bits and skits interspersed between. It has a light-hearted, uninformal tone despite what you might think.

-----
## Purpose
The purpose of this text was to assumably find out more information relating to Obama, as he held presidency from 2008 to 2016, during which was when this interview took place. He was of course, famously the **first black president** in the US, and they want to focus more on him as a person instead of the political side of things.

Because of this he tries to keep things more casual, instead opting to speak on his marriage and birthday. Could be an attempt to empathise with the audience, to be seen as down to earth, and humble in spite of his huge role within his country.

-----
## Audience
The audience would probably be a wide amount of Americans from all of the states. The show itself is very famous and so they try to keep it politically ambiguous - probably hence why the late night talk show is statistically America's most enjoyed talk show - Jimmy Fallon himself explicitly stating in an [[Interviews|Interview]] that he doesn't want to get into politics.
