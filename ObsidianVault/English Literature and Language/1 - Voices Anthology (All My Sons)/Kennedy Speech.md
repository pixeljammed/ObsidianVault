>This is an extract from the speech by John F. Kennedy, as part of a formal ceremony to mark the beginning of his term of office as president of the United States of America.

-----
## Context
Kennedy (John F. Kennedy) was the president of the united states, like [[Obama & Leno|Obama]], but unfortuantely he was shot and killed by a sniper, putting his presidency to a premature end. 

-----
## Purpose
The purpose of this extract was assumably to introduce himself into this position of power and to come off as confident in his role - to further reinforce the strength and power within the states and keep up that reputation of "freedom" and liberty that is almost **synonymous** with America.

There is also a lot of reference to **patriotism** in the speech - phrases like "those who rode of the back of the tiger ended up inside" a metaphor for how the US is like the leading country in the modern age - and those who are not fighting alongside the country are his enemy. He makes his goals clear and unmistakable, in that antagonizing the USA will lead to nothing but a terrible fate.

He tells his allies "however that they need not to worry", *a la* to soothe tension and build good relations with them, a good first impression ("we offer good deeds").

He concludes with the phrase "**let us begin anew**", as if to establish and commemorate a new phase or start for the country, touching on how things may be different, and relations with other countries now open unlike before. In the citizen's mind, he tries to push the belief of "new president = new country".

-----
## Genre
- Speech, Formal
- Authorative tone when he speaks - he's addressing a nation as a whole so he kind of has to, to come off as unimpressionable and serious in his words.
- *Transcript?*

-----

## Audience
The audience of this speech would quite literally be almost all of the residents of the United States, as he speaks as if he's addressing everyone as a collective, so he tries to be neutral while also not coming off as uncertain while he speaks.
