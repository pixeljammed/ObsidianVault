Radio plays are dramatised, purely auditory performances designed to focus on painting a picture in the listener's mind. They rely entirely on dialogue, music, and sound effects.

In the UK you will often hear these on **BBC Radio 4**, for example!

## Conventions of radio drama
From [this site](https://codesandconventionsofradiodrama.wordpress.com/).


_Aural Signposting_ – This is where the setting of the scene is established through audio cues (accents, vehicle sounds, background noises) in place of visual (and sometimes literal) signposts.

_Cliffhanger Endings –_ Used in both audio and visual dramas as a way of keeping the interest of the listener. By not giving them everything, the writer keeps them interested while allowing the listener to have their own experience.

_Use of Fades & Silence –_ Used to signify an end of a scene or a change of scenery. Can even be used to note passage of time or simply for dramatic effect, the tool for keeping the listener as captivated by what they hear as possible.

_Narration & Direct Speech –_ With no visual, the audience is effectively blind. A narrator, breaking the “Fourth Wall” and talking directly to the listener, is the guide. They can quickly relay any vital information that would otherwise slow down the pace of the story.

_Titles & Credits_ – Can be used to bookend the story. Simple audio list of key figures in the production (writer/director/primary and secondary cast members)
