[[Symbolism]] is used a great deal in this play. The most obvious example is probably the **stump of the apple tree**, and how it effectively symbolises the broken family / collapse.

I think another symbol would be the enclosedness of the whole set which the entire play takes place in. The family is kind of shielding off themself from the world with the poplar trees growing either side.  The Kellers have made their peace with the world and want nothing uninvited to come.
