The American Vernacular is the term we use to refer to the every-day, demotic speech  used by Americans. In [[All My Sons Overview|All My Sons]], Miller represents the American Vernacular, the every-day often colloquial language used by the American families of the mid-twentieth century, with which his 1947 audience would be familiar with.

## Example

Sometimes, we might see particular (typically american) **idioms** - a form of expression embedded in a particular language, but not necessarily deducible from the words themselves, for example:
- Chris: ...That kind of thing always **pays off**...
- In British english the phrase "pays off" means something working well in our favour. In this context, or [[American Vernacular]], it means something going bad, in contrast.

-----

I think the reason [[American Vernacular]] is used heavily in *All My Sons* is because Miller wanted to portray a comforting image of typical American family, similar to Henrik Ibsen's realistic-style writing.
He wanted to hold a mirror up to his contemporary American audience and show them themselves.
