In act 3 everything has come to light, and the day is coming to a close, the place being set in darkness. This is the final act, and houses the climax, falling action and denouement of [[All My Sons Overview|All My Sons]].

## Summary
The play happens in a 24 hour span - if you take it from the moment the tree breaks, it is now 2am in act 3, and the 24 hours are almost complete.
The act opens with [[Character of Jim|Jim]] and [[Character of Mother|Kate]]conversing outside. *(page 73-74)*

- In the climax, Chris has stormed out the family home, and Kate and Keller argue to hold onto their beliefs and lies more.
- Kate persuades Keller to "\[tell Chris] that you want to pay for what you did." and says he should be willing to go to prison for his acts.
- Keller pauses, 
- Kate then immediately backpedals, implies that Keller wouldn't actually go to prison, rather it just being a performative act to win back Chris's faith in his family.
- Following this Keller reacts, expressing how he felt he did nothing wrong - "You wanted money, so I made money. What must I be forgiven? You wanted money didn't you?"
	- He immediately puts the blame onto Kate.
	- Keller's perception of himself is of the family patriarch, the man who has done everything for his wife, children, the "man of the house".
	- Over the course of the play, Keller's character arcs from the secure typical familyman, and as more is revealed he fades into the inevitability of tragedy.
- Keller refuses the ideal that his family values are not something shared by his son and wife - "Nothing's bigger than \[the family]. And you're going to tell him, you understand? I'm his father and he's my son, and if there's something bigger than that I'll put a bullet in my head!
- "

- K
	- The play explores the idea

## Quotes
>JIM: "Half my patients are quite mad. Nobody realises how many people are walking loose, and they're cracked as coconuts. Money. Money-money-money-money. You say it so much it doesn't mean anything."

>JIM: Oh, no, he'll come back. We all come back, Kate. These private little revolutions always die. The compromise is always made. In a peculiar way. Frank is right - every man does have a star. The star of one's honesty. And you spend your life groping for it, but once it's out it never lights again.

The star symbolises not just your honesty, but rather the level of trust people place within you as well. It's similar to the boy who cried wolf - after a few faults it is very hard or impossible to regain.
I think the choice of a star to symbolise honesty illustrates it as an ideal virtue. Integral to Chris's own star was his father's - and if his father's star goes out in his eyes so does his, as his world view is completely wrong.



>KELLER: \[his voice is husky. Comes down to her] I don't like him mixing in so much.
>MOTHER: It's too late, Joe. He knows.
>KELLER: \[apprehensively] How does he know?
>MOTHER: He guessed a long time ago.
>KELLER: I don't like that.
>MOTHER: \[laughs dangerously, quietly into the line] What you don't like...
>
>KELLER: Yeah, what I don't like.
>MOTHER: You can't bull yourself through this one, Joe, you better be smart now. This thing - this thing is not over yet. \[...] You better figure out your life.
>
>KELLER: She doesn't know, does she?
>MOTHER: She saw Chris storming out of here. It's one and one - she knows how to add.

>MOTHER: You've got a family. I'm simply telling you that I have no strength to think any more. \[...] All your life whenever there's trouble you yell at me and you think that settles it. \[...] Joe... I've been thinking this way. If he comes back...
>KELLER: What do you mean "if"? ...he's comin' back!

If Chris is not coming back, it would prove his guilt.



>MOTHER: I don't know. I'm beginning to think we don't really know him. They say in the war he was such a killer. Here he was afraid of mice. I don't know him.

>KELLER: Goddam, if Larry was alive, he wouldn't act like this. He understood the way the world is made. He listened to me. To him the world had a forty-foot front, it ended at the building line.

Keller wants control. He wants the theatre's forty-foot front to be
This quote could tie in with the poplars trees - the Keller's way of trying to shield themself from the outside, in a bubble.
