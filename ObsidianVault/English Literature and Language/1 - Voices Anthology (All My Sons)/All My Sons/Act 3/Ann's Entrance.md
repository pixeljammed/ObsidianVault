"crippled Chris in front of me" - Through blatant ignorancegand denial of Larry's death, for the
years since the war ended, Kate hasn't allowed the idea of Larry's death to properly settle for Chris.

She's helped protect Keller from being at any fault and contributed to Chris becoming an accessory in a sense to Keller's past actions. Once the truth came out it was too much for Chris to recover from, since the damage done on him was building up over time to the point that it became too much emotionally.

Ann is determined to put a swift end to the family's episode of delusion. She uses numerous she
sentences ("Larry is dead, Kate" , "please go.") and exclamatives putting an emphasis on her
determination and nonchalance. She clearly has put this to mind as some of her sentences end i ellipsis suggesting she has a lot more in mind to say, suggesting that her speech has been carefully thought out and calculated.

Deus Ex Machina: Is an unexpected power or an event that helps bring resolve/saves a seemingly hopeless situation (usually a contrived plot device within a play or novel).

Ann giving both Kate and Chris the letter from Larry to read, could be seen as a deus ex machina
because it brings a close to the shroud of issues that has forced their family to be permanently stuck the past, finally allowing them to continue with their lives, and seems like a "saving grace" in a extremely convenient time and manner.

"pity and fear" - these stage directions would be a result of Ann's perception that Kate's character is rather fragile, so anything as defining as the letter could deal a big blow to Kate's mental state, but in Anne's view, it's necessary.

"A long low moan" - hyperbole(?) - prime evil self revealed, the moaning reaction suggests
animalistic / instinctive. The moaning is also representative of her being a wounded mother, her grievances towards her lost son. Could draw parallels to wild animals / wolfs howling here.

Kate utters "Oh my god" then "My god, my god", and the repetition here symbolises her utter disbelief when reading, maybe unable to process and vocalise her thoughts so she is stuck repeating the phrase "my god" over and over.

Chris calling himself "yellow" is showing his cowardliness, connotations of self-loathing, yellow =
stained polluted/ morally sick, sick people go yellowy - a slight jaundice colour
Being made "yellow" in the house means that Chris knew about what his father did.
Chris chose the path with the least resistance, becomes pragmatic + realistic = lack of care and humanity within him, lost sight of moral compass.
