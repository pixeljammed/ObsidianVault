Please complete the questions below on Miller's presentation of Jim; Jim makes important comments at the start of Act 3.  These questions and the Act 3 powerpoint part 1 are in Class Notebook.  Please write your answers on the relevant page of Class Notebook.

**What comment does Jim make about his contemporary society and capitalism, in his speech delivered ‘tiredly’ on page 73?**
In his tired speech, Jim reflects on the disillusionment of living in a capitalist society where personal ambitions and moral compromises dominate. He laments the moral decay, suggesting that people prioritise material success over integrity. His tone conveys a sense of resignation and critique of the societal values around him.


**What does Jim reveal to Kate about his ‘knowing’?  Look at the repetition of ‘knowing’.**
Jim’s repetition of "knowing" underscores his awareness of uncomfortable truths about life and morality. This awareness is juxtaposed with his own acceptance of these truths, highlighting his resigned cynicism.


**Comment on Jim’s ‘knowing’.  Is this consistent with what we know of his character?  Why might we see his ‘knowing’ as hypocrisy?**
Jim’s ‘knowing’ is consistent with his earlier portrayal as a realist who understands human frailty. However, his passive acceptance of these flaws could be viewed as hypocritical, as he critiques others while choosing not to challenge or change the status quo.

I think Jim views Keller as only a victim of capitalism - and doesn't believe that he had a choice (i.e: being born into America) or simply chooses to be passive in regards to the subject as he knows efforts would be futile.  


**What does Jim mean when he comments about Chris:**
**"Chris could never know how to live with a thing like that.  It takes a certain talent … for lying. You have it, and I have it. But not him."**
When Jim says Chris "could never know how to live with a thing like that," he highlights Chris's view of a perfect world that he's been raised with . Jim acknowledges his and Kate’s complicity through their "talent for lying," implying a survival mechanism in their flawed world.

I think Kate and Jim obviously underestimate the mental capabilities of Chris - obviously at his age the though of his father's guilt has crossed his mind more than once but assumably he chooses to live in deliberate blissful ignorance. Chris was brought up in his father's walled garden but is not oblivious to the outside world like his father believes.

Some evidence of this would be:
- Him not wanting his name on the family business - (guilty by association).
- Wanting to move away and start a new life with Annie.


**Do you agree that Chris has not known, or that on some level he has always known the truth?**
Chris may not have consciously acknowledged the truth, but the subtext suggests that he likely suspected it on some level. His idealism clashes with the harsh realities of his father’s actions, making his denial a form of self-preservation.



  

Section 1pp. 73-78 (start – MOTHER: “Don’t speak to me”) 

**What is Jim’s view of society and the human condition? What role do you think Jim plays in Act 3? Compare this to his role previously in the play.** 
Jim sees society as a place where self interests rarely line up with a lucrative career. His role in Act 3 sees him in a narrative role, almost like an omnipresence - "I know, Kate, I've always known". This contrasts with his earlier appearances, where he was more passive and deflective of claims or even mentions or his supposed wrongdoing.

**Joe appears mystified that he should be forgiven by Chris. What reason does he give to validate his criminal actions?** 
Joe repeats the phrase "see it human", and that he "did it for the business" and also claims it was the only thing he could do or else risk his entire business. He purports that he had to value and secure his family's wellbeing even at the cost of other lives that he is too shortsighted to see the consequences of.

**What line in Act 3 could be seen as foreshadowing what happens right at the end of the play? (see p77). What, linguistically, suggests Joe’s reasons for making the choice he does at the end of the play?** 
Joe’s dialogue about sacrifice and guilt hints at his eventual suicide. Phrases like "something bigger than me" reflect his internal conflict and foreshadow his dramatic resolution.

**What is the ‘something bigger’ referred to by both Mother and Joe on p77?** 

Section 2 pp. 79-84 (ANN: “I said he’s dead” - end) 

**Chris displays a deep sense of self-loathing in this act. Refer to the dialogue to show how Miller achieves this. What might an audience’s response be to this?** 

 **Joe is a symbol of a morally bankrupt society. Use dialogue and stage directions to support your personal view on this statement.** 
 
**How do Mother, Chris and Ann each deal with the news of what Keller has done?** 

Who do you think is responsible for Joe Keller’s suicide? How is this conveyed through the dialogue and dramatic techniques?
