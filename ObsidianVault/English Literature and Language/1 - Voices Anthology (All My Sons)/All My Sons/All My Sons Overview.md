## **Summary**

[[All My Sons Overview|All My Sons]] is a play written by Arthur Miller, an American playwright, and was written in 1946.

The story follows Joe Keller, a man owned a munitions factory with his friend and neighbour. After being legally trialed and charged with shipping defective aircraft engines during World War II, which lead to the death of 21 pilots, Joe throws his former business partner Steve under the bus. 

It is set over the course of a single day in a small American town (similar to [An Inspector Calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/an_inspector_calls) which we studied at GCSE). It is split into 3 acts which I have made notes on below.

The play explores the Keller family’s complex relationships, which are burdened with shame, denial, guilt, and grief. The play addresses issues of truth, loyalty, wealth, and love. The story questions both the military-industrial complex and the American Dream.

## Acts
The play (as said before) is separated into 3 acts. 
Here you can find a summary of them - what happens in each one
[[#Act 1]]
[[#Act 2]]
[[#Act 3]]


#### Act 1
In the first act we are introduced to the characters, namely Joe Keller, the successful businessman and engineer, who was exonerated after selling faulty airplane parts during WWII, with his former partner Steve Deever taking the blame and going to prison. Joe and his wife, Kate, struggle with the loss of their son Larry, who went missing in the war and she refuses to believe he is dead, while their other son, Chris, hopes to marry Ann Deever, Larry’s former fiancée. 
#### Act 2
In Act 2, George Deever, Ann’s brother, arrives with fresh anger after visiting their father in prison, convinced that Joe is guilty. George tries to prevent Ann’s marriage to Chris because of this, and Joe's actions are found out by his remaining son Chris, who struggles to come to terms with the realisation his father was effectively responsible for the deaths of 21 men, possibly his own son.
#### Act 3
Finally, in Act 3, the truth comes out: Joe’s responsibility for the defective parts is confirmed, and Chris confronts his father’s betrayal and moral failing. Devastated by Joe’s choices and her own delusions about Larry, Kate ultimately must face reality. Eventually it is revealed through a letter, written on the night of Larry's death, that he killed himself because he could not face the guilt from his father being a killer, and crashed himself deliberately. The play ends with Joe, overwhelmed by guilt and realising the impact of his past actions, taking his own life.
