## Character

Greek Tragedy depicts the downfall of a noble or exalted hero or heroine, usually through some combination of hubris (excessive pride or self-confidence), fate, and the will of the gods. The tragic hero's powerful wish to achieve some goal inevitably encounters limits, usually those of human frailty (flaws in reason, hubris, society), the gods (through oracles, prophets, fate), or nature. Aristotle says that the tragic hero should have a flaw (hamartia) and/or make some mistake.

Miller depicts characters in his story likewise as flawed. All of the characters in the Keller family can be arguably seen as 

Keller is immoral and uncaring of the consequences of his actions, which 
Outside of Keller's family he does not care - he only cares for his family and believes that is where his responsibility ends.
