**Chris:** The business! The business doesn't inspire me.
**Keller:** Must you be inspired? 
**Chris:** Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family, I want some kids, I want to build something that I can give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now ... where to I find it?
**Keller:** You mean... {goes to him} Tell me something, you mean you'd leave the business?
**Chris:** Yes. On this I would. 
**Keller:** {after a pause} Well... you don't want to think like that.
**Chris:** Then help me stay here.
**Keller:** All right, but... but don't think like that.  Because what the hell did I work for?  That's only for you, Chris, the whole shootin' match is for you! Chris: I know that, Dad.  Just you help me stay here. 
**Keller:** {putting a fist up to Chris's jaw} But don't think that way, you hear me?
**Chris:** I am thinking that way.
**Keller:** {lowering his hand} I don't understand you, do I?
**Chris:** No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
**Keller:** Yeah, I can see that. Mother appears on porch.  She is in her early fifties, a woman of uncontrolled inspirations and an overwhelming capacity for love.
**Mother:** Joe? 
**Chris:** {going toward porch} Hello, Mom. 
**Mother:** {indicating house behind her.  To Keller} Did you take a bag from under the sink?
**Keller:** Yeah, I put it in the pail. Mother: Well, get it out of the pail.  That's my potatoes.

## Example
**How does Miller present each individual family member's self interest as a **

In this passage, we see the conflicting interests of Keller and Chris through their exchange of dialogue and actions. Chris has an obvious businessman / opportunistic look on life, while Keller, opposingly, wants a family and believes through phrases like "grub\[ing] for money all day long" that if he keeps going the way his father went he'd be unhappy. 

Through the two characters of Keller and Chris, as well as their dialogue Miller presents two sides of the same coin of the American Dream here, using them to illustrate the wants and desires of a stereotypical, inoffensive ,capitalistic, American family. a desire of financial success as well as a cliché 'beautiful family and kids'

Miller uses the context of the war to exacerbate the willing ignorance of the Keller family towards how they've made their money to achieve their American dream.
