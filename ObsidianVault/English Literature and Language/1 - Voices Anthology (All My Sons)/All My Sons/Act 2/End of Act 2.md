This part of the play is where the moral divide between father and son comes to a head.

## Definitions
- **Anagnorisis** -
- **Peripeteia** - a sudden change in a story which results in a negative reversal of circumstances. The turning point, where the tragic protaganist's fortune changes from good to bad.
	- In Act 2 the moment of peripeteia is the reveal of Joe's guilt.
	- If you had to pin it to a moment, I would say Kate "smashing Joe across the face" as it, simply because of the action being described as "smash" - happening instantaneously and with great impact, and the connotation of breaking too.
	- Maybe, when Chris says "\[a broken whisper] Then... you did it?" and when Joe begins his plea thereafter.

## Questions

**How does Miller make effective use of language in the exchanges between Chris and Keller leading to Chris’s monologue at the end of Act 2?** *(Look for stichomythia, epistrophes; incomplete utterances; rhetorical interrogatives; tag question/ monitoring devices)*
- Miller makes great use of stichomythia to build tension between the family dynamics, with Chris and Keller's rapid exchange, as the moral divide between father and son grows bigger. Incomplete utterances mimic how both characters would be grappling to articulate their feelings at this moment in the play. 
- Keller’s use of rhetorical interrogatives and tag questions like "What could I do, let them take my life away?" and "Is that a big thing?" serve as a way to gauge Chris’s reaction, but they also highlight Keller’s attempt to justify his actions and appeal to Chris’s understanding ("the business").
- Conversely, Chris’s language becomes increasingly accusatory, reflecting his growing disillusionment with his father. 
- Keller is unable to control the conversation, and falters while Chris effectively steers the argument wherever he wants.


**Explain in your own words why Chris is so angry with his father?  Write a clear paragraph answering this.**
Chris is angry with his father as he feels he feels that he's been deceived, that his father was in fact responsible for the death of twenty one pilots - and that his father is no longer a man to be looked up to as a result of his actions. Even after he admits his wrongdoing he refuses to believe he harmed his own son, but fails to sympathise with the deaths he caused as well, only further enraging Chris.

**Look carefully at Chris’ language in his monologue. Why does he repeat the adverbial ‘For me!’  What is Chris’ tone here?  Consider how Chris is mocking Joe’s repetition of ‘for you’, as epistrophe.**
The use of epistrophe, like Keller’s repetition of "for you," is mocked by Chris in his monologue as he repeats "For me!" with rising anger and irony, further emphasising the contrast between their moral perspectives.
Chris is infuriated by his father's willing ignorance to think the world stands and ends at his family. When Keller talks about Larry, he said how he liked "he world had a forty-foot front, it ended at the building line."

Chris's use of the word "for me" is an echo utterance, in a more bitter and infuriated tone, outright rejecting Keller's moral pleas of "for you".


**Why does Chris speak in a succession of questions?** 
Chris speaks in a series of questions to highlight his moral outrage. The rapid-fire questioning mirrors his internal turmoil and disbelief that his father could justify such actions. These rhetorical questions are not just directed at Keller but also serve as a reflection of Chris’s own struggle to view someone he idolised be torn down and seen in a vastly different light than what he has ever seen.


**What is Chris’ tone when he utters ‘the business’ which has been Joe’s diacope? Consider also how the noun phrase ‘the business’ is an epistrophe in Chris’ monologue.  How is Chris’ tone different from Joe’s tone when he utters this noun phrase?**
Chris's tone here is bitter, to directly mock the coping of his father putting his immoral actions under the guise of "business" and "family", whereas in previous pages, Joe says this with a moral tone of justification. Chris is directly calling Joe out on his poor justification by comparison. 

**Explain exactly what Chris means by ‘You’re not even an animal, no animal kills his own, what are you?’  Why is this such a powerful moment?**
The character of Chris throughout the book has been his seemingly unwavering loyalty to his own family, and

**Why does Chris ‘pound down upon his father’s shoulder’ with his fist?  Can you compare this act of violence with Kate ‘smashing Joe across the face’ (p 68)?**
Both acts of violence are illustrated in a distinctive way to one another, and the differing verbs ("smash" versus "pound") mirror the characteristics of the people carrying it out. For instance, mother described as "smashing Joe across the face" suggests it happens instantaneously and with great impact, and the connotation of breaking too. This reflects the fragility of her in a way - her emotion throughout the play etc., while Chris "pounding" is less impactful, as if it had an opposite impact on Joe, similar to a bruising pain.

**Why does Chris ‘stumble away, covering his face as he weeps’?  What does this behaviour signify?**
At a basic level it could just show Chris doesn't want others to see him cry, in the face of traditional masculinity. However, it could also symbolise that he is almost ashamed to be related in blood to someone he considers a murderer - he is ashamed to be a part of the Keller family name and covers his face to not be recognised as he leaves.

   
**Do you feel sympathy for Jo as he calls ‘Chris … My Chris…’  Why does he insert the possessive determiner ‘my’ here?**
Joe's use of the possessive determiner "my" conveys his desperation and personal connection to Chris in the moment, revealing his deep sense of loss and regret. It shows Joe’s attempt to reclaim his relationship with his son, emphasising how much he values Chris and views him as his own, despite the rift caused by his actions. The plea humanises Joe, showing his vulnerability and his inability to fully grasp the consequences of his choices on their relationship. 
Personally I feel sympathy for Joe - he is flawed but only human, maybe unable to see past his business like Chris suggests.
