## Key Ideas
1. **The play's moral** or lesson, is that the soldiers fighting and lost in conflict are "all our sons", and the feelings loss and grief felt towards them are a shared emotion.
2. The essay draws parallels from **the real-world WW2 manufacturing struggle** and rush seen over the course of the war's span - as well as the real story that All My Sons was based off.
3. **The ugly side of capitalism** or American: the essay discusses the selfishness of the typical American civilian - said to be "believing in fiction" and that every man should take care of his own interests, as well as how *All My Sons* was not permitted to be produced outside of the USA due to its "negative criticism of American society".
4. The **theatrical history** is discussed, like how Henrik Ibsen heavily influenced Miller's writing, someone who was famously touted as "the father of realism". Miller was very disappointed when Herman Shumlin, a prolific Broadway theatrical director close to Ibsen, didn't understand *All My Sons*. Ironically All My Sons was very successful on Broadway and established Miller as an American social critic and playwright.
5. The **themes found within the play** - described as "the hand of the distant past reach\[ing] out of its grave" by none other than Miller himself. In All My Sons 
6. **Materialism and the American Dream** is recited time and time again in Miller's earlier works, as the essay recounts, citing his beliefs published in his earlier works too. In *All My Sons* materialism is referred to as "the petty business of life in the suburbs" for instance. The relation of corruption and wealth is discussed at length in the essay, in what chapters and evidenced with the quote that Joe Keller says "A little man makes a mistake and they hang him by his thumbs, the big ones become ambassadors."
