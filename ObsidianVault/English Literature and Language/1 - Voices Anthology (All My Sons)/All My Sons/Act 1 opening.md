## Pages 14 - 18

From pages 14 to 18, Joe and Chris Keller conversate about his future - where it's revealed Chris plans to marry his long dead brother's girlfriend. The [[Conversation arcs|conversation arcs]] at the point where his father gets angry at his son potentially leaving the business.

"KELLER: You mean... \[goes to him] you'd leave the business?"
"CHRIS: Yes. On this I would"
"\[pause] Well... you don't think like that."
"Then help me stay here"
"All right... but don't think like that "


Joe's physical actions and anger reveal his inner intentions to get his son to stay in the business - but ultimately Chris still holds the power in this scene. Joe is trying to assert dominance over his son but Chris's dialogue reveals he is indifferent to whatever his father says - having made up his mind. When this doesn't work, Keller gets physical (such as putting his fist up to Chris) and begins exclaiming.
