Look at the ways in which Miller creates dramatic impact of natural speech in combination with rhetorical features.

**Bert's entrance from page 12 to Frank's entrance on page 23.**
## Notes
Bert as a character is only 8 years old and is very innocent.
He represents a way in which Keller **downplays his actions**, almost making a game or joke out of it, but also shows in the opening pages to the reader that Keller is someone considered trusted within the community around the Keller family.

There is great use of both stage directions, ellipsis, and interjections to portray a hectic, unmanaged "scene" within the play, making it seem unstructured and almost tantalising to the watcher.
Bert's re-entrance on page 18 is almost entirely to throw off the structure of the narrative, evidenced by the extensive use of ellipsis, directions of anger like "trying to control herself" and "turning on Keller furiously", and then Ann re-entering.
There is so much going on in one scene, in terms of stage directions, exclamatories, interjections - it leaves the reader feeling sympathetic with Ann, who is subject to the bickering between the Kellers.
