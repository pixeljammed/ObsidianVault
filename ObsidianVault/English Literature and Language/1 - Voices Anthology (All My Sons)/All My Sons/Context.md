## Real world inspiration
The story of [[All My Sons Overview]] was actually inspired by a real company and crime.

- The Curtiss Wright Corporation was a company based in Lockland, Ohio, USA and produced aeronautical engineers for wartime planes for U.S Army Air Force Aircraft between 1941-43.
- Wright officials at Lockland insisted on high engine production levels, resulting in a significant percentage of engines to not meet the *U.S AAF* inspection standards, but were stilled approved by product inspection individuals.
- Inspection officials at Lockland had conspired with civilian technical advisers and Army inspection officers to approve substandard/defective aircraft engines for military use. Therefore **defective engine parts were knowingly sold to the U.S. military in World War II**.
- The Curtiss Wright company's daughter found out about this, and informed the US Govt on what he was doing (snitch ass bitch ass), and this lead to his arrest.

Arthur Miller heard a version of the story from his mother-in-law who had read about it in the newspapers and it became the inspiration for All My Sons.â€‹
