The poplars kind of represent the Keller's family attempts of closing off from the world, and how them growing thicker indicates the family isolating themself from reality when they were shunned by their neighbourhood.
Keller does not want to see America beyond his backyard, uncaring for his community, and thereby symbolically others.

*"Oh, those dear dead days beyond recall!"*
This line seems too deliberate to be simply small talk / an utterance, marked by the alliteration and fashion in which it's delivered, I think Ann
The juxtaposition between dear and dead makes the sentence seem bittersweet
I think unlike Kate, Ann has moved on from the past while the Kellers are stuck in it. In this phrase she has affection for the past (nostalgia) but she doesn't wish to live in it.

*ANN \[slowly rising, a little embarrassed]: Well it never occurred to me that you'd ... I mean the shoes are all shined.*
I think Ann understands that Kate is being deliberately offstandish, and 
I think she didn't realise she was in Larry's room, and "slowly rises" to be cautious to not trigger Kate.
