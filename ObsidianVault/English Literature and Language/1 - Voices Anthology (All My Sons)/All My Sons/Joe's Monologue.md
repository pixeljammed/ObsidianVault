**How would you describe the tone behind Chris' rhetorical interrogative?  What is his point?**
Chris remarks in an sarcastic, almost snide way to his father's confidence - the phrase "So, who flew those P40s? Pigs?" conveying his genuine frustration at his father's (deliberate) obliviousness to the real people that did die. Chris's voice is used here to emphasise the gravity of the situation by highlighting that the defective parts were used by **real** pilots, not some imaginary or expendable beings, highlighting Joe’s rationalisation of the events and unempathetic and short-sighted.

The phrase is also similar to the idiom "when pigs fly" - perhaps to ridicule Keller's lack of responsibility as if to say "oh, so nobody flew those planes?".

**In your own words, explain how Joe attempts to rationalise the decision to ship the cracked cylinder heads.**
Joe defends his actions by framing the situation as chaotic and pressured due to wartime demands. He portrays the workplace as a "madhouse" in his own words, where they had to meet harsh and quick coming deadlines for production. He later then minimises the moral wrongdoing of himself through deliberate use of the pronoun *he*, in reference to Steve and thereby not him - "So *he* takes out his tools and *he*", and by doing so shuts down any guilt and further prodding from either side.

**How does he depict the work place?  Find a quotation to support your point.** 
Joe describes the workplace as a highly stressful environment and time - *“Listen, you gotta appreciate what was doin’ in that shop in the war. It was a madhouse. Every half hour the Major callin’ for cylinder heads, they were whippin’ us with the telephone.”*. The phrasing here illustrates a scene of turmoil and a place driven only by relentless demand, and above all, money.


**Find one utterance from the monologue and analyse how Miller crafts Joe's voice.**
The phrase “*I mean just try to see it human, see it human*” is the phrase that best highlights both Miller's intention and voice with Joe. In his writing Miller aims to humanise the character of Joe,  bringing him to life with the phrases typical of an average, middle class man. [[American Vernacular]], repetition and informal language are used in his speech heavily to emphasise Joe's humanity. The vocabulary used in the phrase - words like "just try" as well as the structured repetition marks Joe's *supposed* empathy - an ironic juxtaposition to the severity of his actions. The choice of language throughout the monologue is deliberately chosen by Miller to create a pleading, almost submissive voice, when Keller needs it most, but as we can see from the ending phrase on the **same page** - "*KELLER: \[Angrily] Annie, I do not understand why you...*", there are two sides to the character of Keller - his voice is dynamic, changing and not to be trusted.

**Keller's voice**
Keller's voice is riddled with use of [[American Vernacular]], repetition, and informal language - a colloquial voice and less educated in a way.

**P40s**
The significance of the P40s
When Keller says "You know Larry never flew a P-40", the line completely
He makes this strong declarative that Larry "never flew" a P-40 - something he could obviously never be sure of.
This phrase best illustrates how Keller constantly claims a false confidence throughout the book. He's *sure* and *assertive* - highlighted by the word "never" -
It typifies Joe's voice as he fails to address the twenty one people who did die as a result of his actions - almost downplaying the severity.
Keller removes himself as far as he can from the  - being sick

**Does Miller encourage us to sympathise with Joe or not? Are you convinced by his narrative? Provide one quotation to support your point.**
I think Miller wanted to split the room to some extent with the monologue of Joe - personally however, I find that Joe's absolute's complete avoidance of absolute responsibility is shown too much for him to be more innocent than not, and I think the deliberate choice to let Joe's ego also shine through in certain phrases "but if I was there" and "...so he's a little man" shows clearly how he's deflecting/minimising his personal responsibility above all.
The repetition of phrases "Just try see it human, see it human", and how "they were whipping us with the telephone " humanises Joe's character as much as Miller can - so I believe he wanted to create a dividing character, who would be viewed morally grey at this moment in the play above anything.
