- Have read up to p.46 (Act 2, “Don’t be alarmed, I said version” [She goes into the house])
- Make notes in answer to the following questions on p.37-46 and submit here:

**What is the cause of Keller feeling “distracted” at the time he is told of Chris’s intention to marry Ann? (p.37)** 
Keller feels “distracted” because he is preoccupied with his own concerns about the implications of Ann’s presence. Her visit stirs unresolved tensions about Larry’s death, her father's imprisonment, and Kate’s lack of acceptance for either or Ann herself.


**What effect is created by the overlapping dialogue (marked “Together”)? (p.38)**  
The overlapping dialogue creates a sense of confusion, urgency, and emotional intensity. It mirrors the chaotic nature of the family dynamics and their attempts to mask or avoid deeper truths. This technique reinforces the disorganized chaos of their conversations and highlights how unresolved tensions disrupt clear communication.


**Why is Chris “a little frightened” as his father declares that “there’s nothing wrong with the money”? (p.38)** 
Chris feels “a little frightened” because Keller’s explicit declaration that to him, he values money over morals. It unsettles Chris, who has built his worldview on integrity and honesty, and it foreshadows the conflict between their values.


**Describe Keller and Kate’s thoughts and feelings encapsulated in the closing stage directions “in hopeless fury” and “stiffly, staring, seeing” respectively? (p.40)** 
The phrase **“hopeless fury”** reflects his frustration with the situation spiralling out of his control. He is trapped by the consequences of his past actions and his inability to reconcile his pragmatic views with the emotional turmoil of his family.


**Setting: what is the significance of the time of day at the beginning of Act 2?** 
The early evening setting signifies a shift toward darkness, both literal and metaphorical. It represents the increasing tension and unease among the characters as hidden truths start to emerge. The fading light also reflects the decline of the family’s façade of harmony.


**Action: what is the significance of Chris sawing the broken tree?** 
Chris sawing the broken tree symbolizes his attempt to move forward and sever ties with the past, particularly Larry’s memory. Additionally, tree stumps are notoriously hard to get rid of fully, as the roots extend deep unground

**Why is Kate/Mother anxious and how is this state of mind shown?** 
Kate’s anxiety stems from her unwavering belief that Larry is still alive and her fear that Ann and Chris’s relationship will confirm Larry’s death. Her state of mind is shown through her obsessive behaviors, contradictions, and emotional outbursts, as well as her fixation on signs that Larry might return.


**Ann says “whenever I need somebody to tell me the truth I’ve always thought of Chris” (p.43). Do you think her view of him is correct?** 
Ann’s view of Chris as truthful and morally upright is partially correct, as he values honesty and integrity. However, I think Chris also avoids *direct* confrontation a lot ("Then who flew those P40s then? Pigs?"), choosing instead to stir the pot rather than outright call out his suspicions or the wrongdoings of others.


**How do Ann and Sue’s perceptions of Chris differ?** 
Ann sees Chris as a person of high moral character, someone who stands for truth and justice, and someone she can rely on emotionally, but Sue views Chris as idealistic to the point of naivety. Sue is cynical and believes Chris is privileged with his father's money, thinking he deliberately chooses to ignore the moral implications of the origin of his wealth.


**Why does Sue think that Jim is trapped?** 
Sue believes Jim is trapped because he is torn between his idealistic aspirations as a doctor and the practical, material demands placed on him by Sue. She feels that Jim has compromised his dreams to provide financial stability, reflecting a broader theme of the tension between personal ambition and societal pressures.


**Why does Sue refer to the Kellers  as “the Holy Family” (p.45)?**
Sue sarcastically refers to ~~the~~ Kellers as “the Holy Family” to mock the moral image they project. She resents how the Kellers, particularly Chris, present themselves as absolutely morally correct, while being wholly hypocritical similtaneously.
