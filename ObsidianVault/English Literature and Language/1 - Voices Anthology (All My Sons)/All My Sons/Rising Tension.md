## Questions
**What is the impact of the quick-fire stichomythic exchange between Keller and Chris?**
I think it is illustrative of how Chris and Keller tread on each other's feet sometimes with their idealism. Chris values morals over money while his father is vice versa, and the briefness of Chris's responses subtly shows his growing disdain for his father's wealth, and maybe growing suspicious and actions. Chris wants to end the conversation ("Now don't get tense, just leave it to me.", "We're getting married, Dad.")
