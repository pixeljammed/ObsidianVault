## Influence
Henrik Ibsen heavily influenced [[Arthur Miller]]when he was writing all my sons and this is shown in 3 main areas.

1. **Genre**: A family drama in the Realism tradition (as if the characters are real people living their lives who we observe through a fourth wall) employing colloquial dialogue and ordinary (middle-class) characters. The Realism is partially augmented through the use of symbolic motifs, stage design and lighting
2. **Plot structure**: “But my own belief is that the shadow of Ibsen was seen on this play for another reason, and it is that All My Sons begins very late in its story. Thus, as in Ibsen's best-known work, a great amount of time is taken up with bringing the past into the present. . . . All My Sons takes its time with the past, not in deference to Ibsen's method as I saw it then, but because its theme is the question of actions and consequences, and a way had to be found to throw a long line into the past in order to make that kind of connection viable.” (Miller 1957)
3. **A strong moral purpose**. Ibsen was motivated to expose what he saw as the hypocrisies of polite middle-class society and the pernicious effect this hypocrisy has on individuals (especially on women – as in A Doll’s House and Hedda Gabler).

## Group work
The play opens in a typical, idyllic fashion showing the average day to day routine of the Kellers, and draws influence on the typical exposition, rising action, climax etc structure that Henrik Ibsen popularised in his own works.

It takes time for the actual drama and tragedy to unfold in All My Sons and because of this Miller gets to establish a familiar feel for us the characters and dynamics between them and what we can expect of them, which makes the revelations in chapter 3 all the more impactful.

The play also has secrets withheld from us, the audience which only later come to light at the most convenient time to have the most impact on us and the character dynamics.

## Symbols in all my sons
- **The poplar trees** - planted by Keller to keep the outside out and the inside in. Keller says when referring to Larry "To him, the world had a forty-foot front. It ended at the building line." expressing his desire to keep his sons in a sandboxed environment, and only believing and seeing inside the family and few neighbours along the duration of the play.
- **The twilight cycle** - both how sunlight gradually falls mirroring the mood of the play at that moment.
- **The gun**
- **Larry's shoes** - which is constantly kept clean by Mother
- **The Apple Tree**
- **The Storm**
- **The planes** - failure of technology and innovation
- **Money and capitalism** - the word money is repeated so often throughout the play (i.e: "money, money, money, you say it so)
