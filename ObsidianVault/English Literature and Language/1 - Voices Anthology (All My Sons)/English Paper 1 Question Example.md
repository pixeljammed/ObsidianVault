## Paragraph
Miller develops Kate as a source of conflict through her sudden, adverse emotional reactions toward the topic of Larry, because of which Keller and Chris tread carefully both in their words and actions when talking to her.
Kate's monologue serves a purpose of establishing her character as one who is rather illusioned or easily influenced - for instance the way she articulates her thoughts the dream she had. Miller deliberately uses an ominous lexis through words like "" and repeating the word *"fall"*, as well as repeated use of ellipsis to suggest her memory being few and far between. Her sudden, erratic stage directions are also evident of this, such as "suddenly realising something... turn[ing] to Keller" and "breaks off, allowing her outstretched hand to fall" - phrases which have an almost theatrical or exaggeratedly performance-like quality to them. Her monologue being performance-like is further backed in this way, 
Both Chris and Keller's dialogue and actions in comparison almost patronise her, for instance when Chris looks at Keller, even though he's talking to Kate, as if to suggest "oh-for-christ's-sake-not-again" or similar to him, or to communicate over Kate's head nonverbally.
The conversation follows a pattern of Chris asking Kate questions, as as if they are walking on eggshells around her, careful not to outright say anything possibly triggering. The conversation arcs when he inevitably does (*"Chris: {hesitantly} About Larry?"*), followed by Chris steering her back into line when Chris and Keller's beliefs conflict with hers. This is evidenced by phrases like *"The wind blew it down. What significance has that got?"*, or *"Mother, please... Don't go through it all again, will you?"*. These phrases have the lexis and tone not of an argument but more of annoyance, establishing Kate to be a character hindering the Keller family from moving on at the beginning of the play.
