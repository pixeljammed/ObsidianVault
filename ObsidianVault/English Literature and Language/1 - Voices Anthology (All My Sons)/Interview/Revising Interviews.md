Revise Obama's interview with Jay Leno.

Revise Diana’s interview with Martin Bashir.  For each interview:

Try to find as many examples of spoken language features as you can.  For each spoken language feature, make notes about what it reveals about the speaker, the speaker's attitude and purpose as well as the dynamic with the other speaker.  

Look for **shifts in register** and **tone** and explore these.  

Look back on your notes and remind yourself of the **context** of this interview.

Then, find 3-4 points of comparison between these two texts, comparing how the speakers in each text create a sense of voice.  For each point, write clear and complete sentences about how the speakers create a sense of voice.  

  

If you want, you can continue to write a paragraph after each comparative sentence, developing the point, including quotation and linguistic analysis, then returning to the effect on the reader.

  Dana's interview with Martin Bashir reveals a complex linguistic landscape where her spoken language serves multiple strategic purposes. Her linguistic choices consistently reflect a nuanced attempt to navigate personal vulnerability, institutional critique, and maternal protectiveness.

Throughout the interview, Diana employs conversational hedging as a sophisticated communication strategy. Phrases like "I mean" and "you know" soften potentially controversial statements, allowing her to express challenging perspectives about the monarchy while maintaining a sense of diplomatic restraint. These linguistic markers reveal her acute awareness of public perception and her desire to be seen as thoughtful rather than confrontational.

Repetition emerges as a powerful rhetorical tool in her communication. When she emphatically states, "I know I can, I know I can, yes," she creates a sense of emotional conviction that transcends mere verbal communication. This linguistic technique serves to build personal credibility and communicate an almost visceral sense of self-belief, inviting the audience to trust in her capabilities and intentions.
