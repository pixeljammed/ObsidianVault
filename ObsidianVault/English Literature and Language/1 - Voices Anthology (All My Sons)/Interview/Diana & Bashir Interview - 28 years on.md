Looking back on the infamous interview almost 30 years later it gives us an insight into how Diana spoke in the face of reporters. To get an interview with such people high up - royalty -is a hard thing to do and for a good reason too. 

Think about why **the Queen** doesn't say much (aside from her traditional Christmas speech). It's because she's the figurehead of a whole country. If she even so spoke on a topic the media would be all over it, because if you give the press an inch, they'll take a mile, spouting stories as far stretched as like deem fit, and the entire country laps it up like milk.

The BBC is no different, and it was apparent here, with **Mister Bashir** asking questions almost coercing Diana into badmouthing the royals, each question more assertive and intrusive than the last arguably.
Diana had none of it clearly - instead she chose to write off and almost masterfully dodge these questions - I mean she has to be good at it, she's a political figure. It's not uncommon to see interviews like this - take the more recent Prince Phillip interview on his ties to the world's most famous nonce **Mr Jeffery Epstien;**

Now while nobody can really confirm anything except the man himself, he obviously won't speak an ounce of truth. In the 58 minute interview where he claims he was "misguided", it ended up with him resigning from his public role, which arguably seems guilty by his lack of words.

From this you can almost gather the media always wants to stir the pot - because that's what gets them clicks. No matter what was going on with Diana they try and make it seem bad because, well that's what they do best. If Diana said something too giving, the headlines would be ringing loud of claims of everything. If she said nothing however, it would arguably be even worse for her.
No matter what you do or say they will make it look bad - they will throw you a curveball in questions, they'll pressure you and coerce you into a corner to make you seem cowardly. It is a fine line Diana had to tread or she would risk a scandal.

Instead the public deemed the opposite. While Diana quite masterfully handled the questions, even pushing back against the almost attacking subtly questions,
