## Notes
"A trench filled with muddy water" - the text uses post-modification of nouns.
"At last I was to play a real part in the Great War" - contextual reference, which is what they would have called WW1 at the time. This of course links to the propaganda at the time.
"I was to be given an opportunity of doing something useful" - Note how opportunity is used, as if the abstract noun suggests that he is proud of this privilege.
