## Questions
**What can you deduce about the audience of this review?**
The audience would probably be active readers (no doubt) and more specifically people who might want to expand their reading taste + find new but good books from critics.

#### Paragraph 1 and 2
**How does the writer use specific genre conventions to engage the intended audience?**
Like the typical structure of a review, it starts off with an introduction to the author and book, giving us contextual information, and then a brief retelling of the plot, giving the reader a brief taster and perhaps interest in it.

All reviews are arguably more or less

More specifically to this review, the second paragraph immediately presents a conflicts

#### Paragraph 3 + 4 + 5
**Identify five examples of evaluative language used by the writer. For each one**
- *"Whitwham's writing is as sharp as a one-two combination"* - both an intertextual reference as it's using boxing terms, and also a metaphoric simile.
- *"The book is tender, too"* - as if to say personify the book and give it emotion like a human, saying how it has another side to it/duality.
- *"There's something of Shakespeare's emotionally stunted warrior, Coriolanus, in Bobby"* - by comparing one of her characters to a culturally renowned writer

## Paragraph
Flemmich Webb creates a voice accordant to the very media he is reviewing, keeping in tune with the informal world of east-end London sung about in the novel. His writing suggests confidence in both what he is reviewing and himself, rightfully appraising the strengths of the book as well as the author, describing her as having authenticity.

His voice takes on a character - in paragraph 3 for instance, *"Whitwham's writing is as sharp as a one-two combination"* sounds like someone you might expect to be in the book themself, using boxing terminology to fit with the review.

He uses intercultural references too - comparing Anna Whitwham's character of Bobby to one of shakespeare's with the quote *"There's something of Shakespeare's emotionally stunted warrior, Coriolanus, in Bobby"*. By making this comparison to a culturally renowned writer, it makes his voice seem authentic with the British and London theme in question.
