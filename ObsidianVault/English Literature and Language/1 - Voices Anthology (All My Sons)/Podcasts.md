>Podcasts are a digital audio file made available on the internet for downloading to a computer or mobile device, typically available as a series, new [instalments](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&hs=uZ7&sca_esv=569891204&sxsrf=AM9HkKnR5RL5xj1VlV3zYIMR7eg5uf5Kdg:1696192949683&q=instalments&si=ALGXSla0Spp1kHC9LAamd4BHsp51KrjSv0eLYWcikFWivU5B4dHB1z4Sor3h8YTdsEWnbS4aJDOI8AnE3T0EJhQeV4Om16WKTADt5AkC93tfDCiv8QFTJwA%3D&expnd=1) of which can be received by subscribers automatically.

Podcasts aren't music - they typically consist of multiple people conversing in relation to a specific topic.
Some examples of podcasts:

- The Joe Rogan Experience
- Cold Ones
- Misfits podcast

Obviously podcasts differ to traditional literature because they are in audio form and don't have a typical structure/are planned - there may be topics prepicked to talk about but overall the whole thing is kind of "winging it" and the entertainment value stems directly from this spontaneity.

I think the purpose of the podcast "Past Masters Podcast: ‘The Truth is in Here: UFOs at The National Archives" (which you can read a transcript of at https://media.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php/the-truth-is-in-here-ufos-at-the-national-archives/) is to discuss the unknown and provide a mystery to the listener and explore what is beyond us - it naturally piques our curiosity - an interesting topic for sure! 
The potential audience here would probably have to be those interested in the supernatural - sceptics, theorizers, conspiracists, you name it, they would all probably be ones who'd listen to this sort of stuff and take an interest in its content.
