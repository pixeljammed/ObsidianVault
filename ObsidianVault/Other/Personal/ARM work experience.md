I particularly want to work at ARM because it's among the big names in cutting edge tech development. I am familiar with their development in chip architecture and it's something I am very interested in.


I have always taken a big interest in tech, both in hardware and software
My projects in hardware have been:
- Built my own PC 
- Made a IoT raspberry-pi powered automatic dog feeder
- Currently making a local home PLEX server

For software development stuff I have:
- Maintained a oracle cloud-hosted Minecraft + CS:GO server for 8 months
- Good familiarity with all 3 major OS's
- Currently making my own video-game in Godot
- Self taught LUA and Godot, and good knowledge of Python + C#
- Developed a website for downloading Minecraft mods
- Used Tensorflow for machine learning data analysis (google cloud).

The location is also convenient for me as I commute to college in Cambridge daily, so transport would not be an issue.
I think it would be great to explore and deepen my understanding of computer engineering and hardware + software development, and I think ARM would be a great place for this as my friend's dad has told me about it from working there himself.
