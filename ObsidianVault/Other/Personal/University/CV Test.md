Notes:
•	This is an example CV, make sure you make it your own and don’t copy this one! Ideally you should be tailoring your CV to the job that you are applying for – look at the person specification for the job and ensure that the things that the employer is asking for are clearly shown on your CV.
•	This CV would be suitable to use to apply for a part-time job whilst at college, for a work experience placement (if asked for) or a job or apprenticeship after Hills Road.
•	CVs should no longer include your date of birth or National Insurance Number and increasingly people are not including their address. This is partly to ensure your online security, but also to help limit discrimination.
•	For similar reasons, don’t include your referees’ personal details; it also uses up valuable space!
•	You don’t have to follow this format exactly, there are lots of different ways you can lay out a CV! Websites you can look at include: www.reed.co.uk www.monster.co.uk and [Nationalcareersservice](https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/) 
•	Make sure your spelling and grammar are really accurate – ask someone to check it for you
•	Don’t include a photo on your CV.
•	Keep the format simple, stick to a black font and don’t try fancy layouts
•	For a sixth former, a one page CV is fine, but definitely don’t go over 2 pages. You don’t have to list everything you’ve ever done, but include the things that are most relevant and recent.
•	Give the document your name eg; first name surname CV.doc so the employer can easily find it.

Do pop into Careers for help, we’d be happy to have a look at your CV.
