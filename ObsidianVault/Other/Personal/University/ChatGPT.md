From an early age, I was captivated by computers. At the age of five, I would eagerly anticipate our primary school’s computer lessons and spent hours at home tinkering with hardware and software. Building my own PC at ten (with help from dad, of course!) was a proud moment, but more than that, it solidified my deep-rooted passion for understanding how technology works. This curiosity has shaped my ambitions to become an adept programmer or cybersecurity professional, where I can leverage my skills and experiences to contribute to the rapidly evolving field of computer science.

My journey through computer science has been hands-on and multi-faceted, ranging from hardware projects like creating an IoT-powered automatic dog feeder using a Raspberry Pi to building a local home PLEX server for my family’s entertainment. These ventures not only allowed me to gain understanding of how hardware and software interact, but to enjoy and gain worthwhile experience in tech too. I am continuously looking for ways to apply my knowledge, currently by learning to optimize and configure systems for efficient local use.

In software development, I have delved into both personal and academic projects, developing a solid foundation across multiple programming languages. I have self-taught Linux, which I use to host gaming servers for Minecraft and CSGO, and I am proficient across all major operating systems. A highlight of my academic journey was creating a 3D platformer shooter video game using Godot as part of my A-Level NEA project, where I explored universal design principles to make the game accessible across languages. The project challenged my creativity, as I used audio and visual signposting to create a game that could be understood universally, without reliance on written text. This experience solidified my interest in game development while sharpening my problem-solving and design skills.

My passion for cybersecurity has been equally significant. I have obtained the ISC2 CC cybersecurity certification and am currently working towards the CISSP certification, a credential typically pursued by professionals with much more experience. The process has deepened my understanding of network security, risk management, and information systems, which I hope to expand upon during my university studies. In addition to certifications, my work experience at CHQ Architects allowed me to interface with cutting-edge server technology and understand the infrastructure that underpins secure systems. This experience, along with tutoring younger peers in computer science, has strengthened my communication skills and reinforced my desire to contribute to this field.

Beyond technical skills, I believe in the value of curiosity, persistence, and social engagement. I have attended talks at institutions like ARM and Cambridge University on topics such as cybersecurity, web development, and open-source technologies, which broadened my perspective on the potential and ethical implications of computer science. Outside of academics, I maintain a balance through recreational swimming and socializing with friends, allowing me to approach challenges with a clear mind and a collaborative spirit.

Ultimately, I aspire to be at the forefront of technological advancement, using computer science to solve complex, real-world problems. Whether it is contributing to the cybersecurity sector or exploring AI and machine learning, I am eager to harness the skills and knowledge gained through my degree to push the boundaries of what is possible. I look forward to joining a university environment that fosters innovation, collaboration, and exploration, where I can continue to evolve as a programmer and cybersecurity professional.
