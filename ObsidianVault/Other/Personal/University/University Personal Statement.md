I was first introduced to the power of computers by my father, and with his encouragement, I found myself with a natural interest in them and their capabilities. Soon enough, by the age of 9 I had taught myself Python, and by 12 I could program sufficiently in 5 different languages, which I have used for a variety of applications.

My interest in this subject has forever exceeded just learning in school, evidenced by the wide and expanding portfolio I have of work relating to computer science. I have my own website where I showcase all the personal projects I have created both past and present.
Many times I've sought and learnt outside of what's taught in the curriculum, for instance, I have created multiple games available free to download online, to varying degrees of popularity and success. I launched my first game at 11 in the programming language Lua, which garnered 15,000 players within the first 3 months alone. Since then I have gone on to make more, such as a disability-friendly 3D platformer + exploration themed game for my EPQ. Most recently a few months ago I entered into a "game jam" (a video game from scratch competition) with a team of friends, where I lead the programming and design direction of the game, as well as the writing, while collaborating with a team of artists and sound designers, using the Godot game engine.

More projects I have completed involved self-teaching myself cloud-computing and Linux, so I could run my own game servers free of charge for friends. The sector I am most proud of and what I'm focusing on now is software engineering, and I currently have an app on the apple app store for users to track their calories for dieting. I'm in the process of building a cross-platform commercial app that helps GCSE and A-Level students study efficiently and stay organised. Aside from apps I have contributed to FOSS (free open source software) projects, such a module for primitive physics code, involving kinetic energy calculations, and 

Recently I went to the InfoSec Europe convention 2024 in London, where I was one of, if not the youngest people to attend, and spoke to Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Amazon to name a few, about their companies' cybersecurity.
Currently I am working towards my CISSP certification - the so called "gold standard" for cybersecurity; an exam typically taken by people twice my age.

Hardware is one of my passionate interests - first beginning with a Raspberry Pi gifted to me for my birthday, I created a emulator for retro arcade games for my uncle. Following this I've since made progressively more advanced projects - going on to making a multitude of bespoke physical electronic products for clients. The last product I made was a automated pet feeder which could dispense pet kibble on a schedule for my neighbours and their dog, or manually by sending a text message, per their specifics. More recently I've helped numerous friends select components and build their own PCs, and I am currently creating a project based around machine learning, or computer vision; a turret that can shoot clay pigeons when thrown at high speeds.

Outside of the curriculum I have completed various to 
During Y13 I applied to be a tutor for Computer Science, and taught peers in both years all aspects of the curriculum, and as well as this, completed a weeks' worth of work experience at CHQ architects, where I completed tech-based & subject related work. From both of these experiences I can say
