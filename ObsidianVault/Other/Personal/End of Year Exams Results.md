## Reflections
**Computer Science**


**Maths**
I think I did very well in the EoY test, beating out a lot of my friends who did significantly better than me in the other tests, and I was 2 marks off a B.


**English**
I was not expecting to perform that awfully in the end of year exam. That was really bad - like fall to my knees in the middle of Tesco bad. 
However it is probably a wake up call as my performance in english has been dropping off to be honest. 
From this point I should try study english a lot more often. I haven't really revised ever except for that one week in the lead up to the exam and I think it is time to incorporate revision of it into my timetable.
