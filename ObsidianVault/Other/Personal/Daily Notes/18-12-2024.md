Dear Mr Pryer

I understand you are assumably very busy, considering it's the final week of term, but I would like to request a final re-review of my predicted grade for A-Level mathematics.

This is something very important to me - I have spoken long and hard about this to the maths department, and I read the in college guidance document that if all else fails to then go speak to the deputy head of year. Considering it is the last week of term, I would really like to be able to put my university application to rest before Christmas. I have been in discussions about this for so long I am seeing my peers receive offers from their universities already.

I believe fully that my current predicted grade does not accurately reflect what I am **certain** I can achieve in my actual A levels.

The reason for this is that **I do not believe the maths department fairly took into account my exceptional circumstances**, which happened during year 12, when they were calculating my grade.

During year 12 – the year in which my WAG was last calculated – the college did not give me the support I was entitled to and offered, thanks to a mix up with _three_ different form tutors within the space of 2 terms. There is evidence of this attached below.

I would like to re-appeal this grade change, before the next opportunity to formally appeal at a stage 2 (head of department), based on this.

If I were to re-appeal when my WAG is updated instead, it would be cutting it **extremely close to the official UCAS deadline** and potentially make me miss out on my university offers, which I why I want to discuss this with you ***now*** as opposed to after Christmas break.

This email is separated out into sections to help be more understanding, as I think that’d be helpful for you or others.

1. Recap of events related to grade.
2. Details and evidence regarding my circumstances during Y12.

**Recap of events related to my grade:**

This is simply to clarify what action has been done in regards to my UCAS grade so far.

May 2024 – Maths mock taken

June 2024 – Results given back, mark of 43, 2 marks off a B. Predicted UCAS C

July 2024 1st week  – Asked maths teacher Mr Hatton, who redirected me to Mr Hacking.

July 9th 2024– Email sent to Mr Hacking, asking to change my UCAS grade to A.

September 20th 2024– Mr Hacking agrees to change it, but only to B.

October 2nd  2024 – In person meeting with Mr Hacking, where I was informed due to college policy he could not change my grade until around Christmas time / after U6MA3 / after PR meetings.

November 29th 2024 – Internal college deadline for UCAS passes.

December 11th 2024 – PR meeting with Stuart Hatton

December 16th 2024 – Latest test, U6MA3 is marked, in which I receive 70%, typically considered an A.

On the same day I message Mr Hacking – here is the response (for clarities’ sake)

I would like to acknowledge briefly that both my teacher Mr Hatton, and head of maths Mr Hacking have been helpful throughout the process of all this and to thank them both.

**Details and evidence regarding my circumstances during Y12.**

**Event 1 - Relationship breakdown**

During year 12 I struggled with a relationship breakdown at home with my father, events which are documented on the college internal IT system.

I would not like to go into details in regard to this matter, but you may want to consider how difficult it might be to revise for a test when there is a lot of yelling and shouting, etc. between you and a family member at the same time.

I would not like to extend any further however just to give you an idea the yelling and shouting was the least of the problems - I was in an environment which made it very difficult to study.

I have spoken to safeguarding in relation to this and I am fine now. Me and my father are now on good terms thanks to extensive therapy for our family following the events. If evidence is needed of this, I have attached a letter from the 19th of April from my counciling psychologist to Joy Michalou, my form tutor.

**Event 2 – ADHD diagnosis**

On the 1st May I was diagnosed

If you plot my math test scores taken directly from ProPortal on a graph, and then line up the events listed above, the results see a direct correlation.

I think the image speaks for itself, however you can see an obvious increase when medication, therapy started.

If you were to interpolate this graph, you would see my Y12 performance without such events would have been considerably better.

![](file:////Users/milotek/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image003.png)

It is an extremely safe assumption to make that I will perform significantly better in Y13 and in the final exam than in Y12.

I am arguing that to base my UCAS grade solely off my past performance, while not taking into account these circumstances, would be inaccurate.

**Other evidence**

I have also had a maths tutor at least once a week, every week. I have had **30 lessons** from him

Below I have attached an informal review of my understanding of the subject and skill from him – who has taught me for almost a year.

“I have been tutoring Milo since March 2024 and in that time I have seen considerable improvement in both his work ethic and his understanding of the Maths.  He seemed to be struggling a bit when I first stepped in, but now he is grasping topics and gaining a deeper understanding much more quickly than he was back in March.

I firmly believe that Milo will be able to achieve an A grade in the summer examinations, based upon what I am seeing in our lessons.

I have been teaching Maths for 30 years, including being a Head of Maths in two schools.  For the last 14 years of that time I have been specialising in one to one tuition.

I am happy for you to ask me further questions if you need to.

**Mishandling of college support**

In January of 2023, we were told via email by Sara Halliwell that I would be receiving SEN support due to my formal diagnosis of autism.

This includes (explicitly stated in email):

-  “a named Learning Mentor who will meet with him regularly”
- “registered timetabled slots on his timetable for more structure to his day”

When I entered college in September 2023, I received no support or accommodation like this until April of 2024 – a full 7 months into the academic year. This means, during all the tests which I had in year 12, I was virtually unsupported and struggled quite a bit to organise myself. This even further cooperates with the chart above, and also affected my mental health a lot (burnout).

I believe this was because I had 3 different form tutors during Y12. My current turor is absolutely amazing, however the previous two were uncommunicative and hard to get a hold of. My mother tried numerous times to call / message as she was very concerned about my mental health during this time, and was met with ***one*** communication – which she never heard back from after.

6th March 2024 – Mum contacts Joy Michalou (current form tutor)

15th March 2024 – Joy confirms the study skills I was promised is finally in place
